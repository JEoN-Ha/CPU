25867024|t|Role of ALADIN in Human Adrenocortical Cells for Oxidative Stress Response and Steroidogenesis.
25867024|a|UNASSIGNED: Triple A syndrome is caused by mutations in AAAS encoding the protein ALADIN. We investigated the role of ALADIN in the human adrenocortical cell line NCI-H295R1 by either over-expression or down-regulation of ALADIN. Our findings indicate that AAAS knock-down induces a down-regulation of genes coding for type II microsomal cytochrome P450 hydroxylases CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 and their electron donor enzyme cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, thereby decreasing biosynthesis of precursor metabolites required for glucocorticoid and androgen production. Furthermore we demonstrate that ALADIN deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and alteration in redox homeostasis after paraquat treatment. Finally, we show significantly impaired nuclear import of DNA ligase 1, aprataxin and ferritin heavy chain 1 in ALADIN knock-down cells. We conclude that down-regulating ALADIN results in decreased oxidative stress response leading to alteration in steroidogenesis, highlighting our knock-down cell model as an important in-vitro tool for studying the adrenal phenotype in triple A syndrome.

11914417|t|Progressive bulbospinal amyotrophy in triple A syndrome with AAAS gene mutation.
11914417|a|Triple A (3A) syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by adrenocorticotropic hormone-resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia of the cardia, alacrima, and variable autonomic and neurologic dysfunction. The gene responsible, AAAS, recently has been identified. We describe the neurologic phenotype of the first adult case of 3A syndrome presenting bulbospinal amyotrophy as the prominent sign in association with a homozygous nonsense mutation identified in the AAAS gene.

10184062|a|Several years ago, central questions in the AIDS research field were: Is it possible to develop a vaccine against HIV? If so, when, and what strategies show the most promise? Now, even with no safe and effective vaccine in the pipeline, attention is nonetheless shifting towards potential problems associated with selecting the populations most in need of the product, conducting the clinical trials, and delivering the vaccine in a fair and equitable manner. These problems were the focus of a session at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), held in San Francisco in February. The following articles summarize two of the presentations at the session.

20374727|t|The molecular basis of adrenocorticotrophin resistance syndrome.
20374727|a|Adrenocorticotrophin resistance syndromes comprise familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) and triple A syndrome, which are rare autosomal recessive diseases with distinct clinical features and molecular etiologies. Mutations of melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R) have been described in segregation with FGD in 25% of patients. More recently melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP), a small single-transmembrane domain protein, was described as an essential protein for the traffic of MC2R and its expression on the plasma membrane. About 20% of FGD patients carry homozygous mutations of MRAP. The ALADIN protein (for alacrima/achalasia/adrenal insufficiency/neurologic disorder) was identified as the molecular basis of triple A syndrome. The elucidation of the genetic basis of the ACTH resistance syndrome has contributed to the better understanding of MC2R function. However, in some patients the molecular etiology is not yet known and awaits further genetic studies.

23861206|t|Triple A syndrome in Japan.
23861206|a|INTRODUCTION: Triple A syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease, characterized by esophageal achalasia, alacrima, and adrenal insufficiency, as well as involvement of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems. This disease mimics amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in some patients. The causative gene encodes ALADIN, a nuclear pore complex (NPC) component. Only 5 patients have been reported in Japan. METHODS: We conducted the first nationwide survey of triple A syndrome. Identified mutants were expressed as GFP-fusion proteins in cultured cells. RESULTS: Two new patients were identified, and 1 had a novel mutation (p.Ser182fsX19). All mutant proteins tested were mislocalized from NPC to cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: The most consistent neurological manifestation of triple A syndrome in Japanese patients was progressive bulbospinal muscular atrophy with both upper and lower motor neuron involvement, which mimicked motor neuron disease, similar to that seen in patients in Western countries. The identification of the new patients suggests that more cases are undiagnosed in Japan.

16970037|t|Heterogeneity of the triple A syndrome and assessment of a case.
16970037|a|Allgrove syndrome (triple A syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, and--occasionally--autonomic instability. Disease causing mutations have been found in the AAAS gene on 12q13, but no strong phenotype-genotype correlation could be found. We present a 28 year-old woman with classical systemic features of triple A syndrome with prominent neurological dysfunctions/deficits, including distal muscular atrophy, progressive muscle weakness and wasting of both legs, sensibility dysfunction, hyperreflexia and autonomic dysfunction presented with excessive sweating. DNA sequencing of the AAAS gene revealed compound heterozygosity for previously reported mutations. A similar genotype was previously reported, but with a remarkably different phenotype.

21686524|t|Triple A syndrome: two novel mutations in the AAAS gene.
21686524|a|Triple A syndrome is a rare disease of autosomal recessive inheritance. It was first described in 1978. The typical triad includes adrenocorticotrophic-hormone-resistant glucocorticoid insufficiency, reduced or absent tearing (alacrima) and achalasia. But clinical symptoms can be extremely heterogeneous and of variable clinically expression. This report describes a 7-year-old boy with a 1 year history of fatigue and muscle weakness. Physical examination showed skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation, and hormonal analysis revealed isolated glucocorticoid function. Medical history was marked by megaoesophagus and achalasia. The absence of tears when crying had been noted since birth. In the presence of the classical triad, triple A syndrome was diagnosed. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed by molecular analysis of the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13. The novel compound heterozygous mutation c.1304delA and c.1292-1294delTTCinsA was found.

15843079|t|Idiopathic achalasia is not allelic to alacrima achalasia adrenal insufficiency syndrome at the ALADIN locus.
15843079|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates that patients with familial achalasia associated with Allgrove or triple-A syndrome (i.e. alacrima, achalasia and adrenocorticotropin-resistant adrenal insufficiency with neurological impairment) have mutations of the alacrima achalasia adrenal insufficiency syndrome (AAAS) gene. AIM: The present study was aimed at identifying possible AAAS gene mutations in patients with established idiopathic non-familial achalasia. METHODS: Genomic DNA of 41 patients was isolated from peripheral blood cells using standard methods. The 16 exons of the AAAS gene (or ALADIN) were screened for mutations using the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography method. RESULTS: Four heterozygous nucleotidic variations have been identified in patients with idiopathic achalasia, among which three were exonic conservative polymorphisms [i.e. D138D (GAT--&gt;GAC), L227L (TTG--&gt;CTG) and F285F (TTC--&gt;TTT) in exons 5, 7 and 9, respectively]. The fourth nucleotidic variation was located in intron 13 (IVS14-23delT). All variants have been regarded as polymorphisms resulting in a normal ALADIN protein since they are either conservative or lying outside the consensus splice sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support a pathogenetic role for common AAAS gene mutations in patients with idiopathic achalasia as seen in Allgrove syndrome. These findings suggest the participation of different mechanisms in the pathogenesis of idiopathic achalasia.

16609705|t|Cellular localization of 17 natural mutant variants of ALADIN protein in triple A syndrome - shedding light on an unexpected splice mutation.
16609705|a|The triple A syndrome is a complex and multisystemic autosomal recessive disease with the 3 main symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, and achalasia accompanied by neurological impairment. Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 are responsible for the disorder. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN, which belongs to the family of WD-repeat-containing proteins and has been shown to localize to nuclear pore complexes. The function of the protein is not clear. It is supposed that ALADIN plays an important role in RNA and (or) protein trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm. With transfection experiments, we analyzed the cellular localization of the wild-type and 17 natural mutant variants (9 missense, 5 nonsense, 3 frameshift mutations) of ALADIN. We show that most mutations cause mislocalization of the mutant ALADIN proteins in the cytoplasm. In contrast, some variants with mutations located at the N-terminus (Q15K, L25P) and 3 artificial C-terminus mutations (Q490X, R493X, and V497X) remain at the nuclear pore. Using a patient cell line, we show that the mutation 43C&gt;A in exon 1 does not cause a missense mutation Q15K but, rather, results in aberrant splicing.

18551317|t|Clinical and molecular genetic findings in a 6-year-old Bosnian boy with triple A syndrome.
18551317|a|The triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is characterised by the triad of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. In most patients, neurological and dermatological abnormalities are associated features. We report on the first Bosnian patient with triple A syndrome. Endocrine investigation confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5.8 years. Two months later, achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this patient. Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The parents are both heterozygous carriers of the mutation. The affected twin brother unfortunately died from hypoglycaemic shock, despite a normal cortisol rise in an ACTH stimulation test. Further, triple A syndrome patients carrying the identical homozygous p.W84X mutation have to be studied to assess a genotype-phenotype relationship for this mutation.

26243364|t|Low bone mineral density for age/osteoporosis in triple A syndrome-an overlooked symptom of unexplained etiology.
26243364|a|Triple A syndrome (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal failure, progressive neurodegenerative disease) is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene which encodes the protein alacrima achalasia adrenal insufficiency neurologic disorder (ALADIN). Our investigation suggests that low bone mineral density (BMD) for age/osteoporosis could be a common but overlooked symptom of unexplained etiology in this rare multisystemic disease. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to evaluate incidence and etiology of BMD for age/osteoporosis, a possibly overlooked symptom in triple A syndrome. METHODS: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, and radius, bone turnover markers, minerals, total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD), 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25-OH2D), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), and adrenal androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione) were measured in five male and four female patients. RESULTS: At time of diagnosis, low BMD for age was suspected on X-ray in seven of nine patients aged 2-11  years (not performed in two patients); normal levels of minerals and ALP were found in nine patients and low levels of adrenal androgens in eight patients (not measured in one patient). Reevaluation 5-35  years after introduction of 12  mg/m(2)/day hydrocortisone showed low BMD for age in two children, osteopenia in one, and osteoporosis in six adults. Normal levels of minerals, ALP, PTH, 1,25-OH2D, procollagen type 1, crosslaps, and osteocalcin were found in all patients. Low levels of adrenal androgens were found in all and 25OHD deficiency in six patients. Body mass index was &lt;25  % for age and sex in eight of nine patients. CONCLUSION: Low BMD for age/osteoporosis in our patients probably is not a result of glucocorticoid therapy but could be the consequence of low level of adrenal androgens, neurological impairment causing physical inactivity, inadequate sun exposure, and protein malnutrition secondary to achalasia. Considering ubiquitous ALADIN expression, low BMD/osteoporosis may be a primary phenotypic feature of the disease. Besides optimizing glucocorticoid dose, physical activity, adequate sun exposure, appropriate nutrition, and vitamin D supplementation, therapy with DHEA should be considered.

20051279|t|Triple A syndrome: a novel compound heterozygous mutation in the AAAS gene in an Italian patient without adrenal insufficiency.
20051279|a|Allgrove syndrome (or triple A syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by alacrima, achalasia, ACTH-resistant adrenal insufficiency and autonomic/neurological abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene, located on chromosome 12q13. We describe a 42-year-old patient who presented with neuropathy and was found to have alacrima, achalasia, mild autonomic dysfunction with significant central and peripheral nervous system involvement. She was later diagnosed with oligosymptomatic triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the AAAS gene identified two heterozygous mutations within exon 14 and its donor splice site (p.L430F-c.1288C&gt;T and c.1331+1G&gt;T), one of which is novel. Allgrove syndrome should be suspected in patients with neurological impairment associated with two or more of the main symptoms (alacrima, achalasia or adrenal insufficiency).

17880786|t|[Allgrove syndrome in the mainland of China: clinical report and mutation analysis].
17880786|a|OBJECTIVE: Allgrove syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima and many cases have multi-systems disorder: endocrine, gastrointestinal tract, eyes and nervous system. This syndrome is also known as achalasia-addisonianism-alacrima syndrome or triple A syndrome. Allgrove syndrome is now known to be caused by mutations of AAAS gene encoding the aladin protein. In the present paper, we report a Chinese mainland girl with Allgrove syndrome with mutations in the AAAS gene. METHOD: The patient was a 7-year-old girl complained of coma and dark skin; she was treated as Addison disease for 2 years and had vomiting for 9 months before the second admission. Gene analysis was performed after extracting genomic DNA by amplification and sequencing of the specific fragments of AAA gene. RESULTS: The patient was confirmed to have adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5 years and 6 months. During the second hospitalization, she was found to have a remarkable brisk reflexion, bilateral optic nerve atrophy, alacrima and achalasia besides ACTH resistance. The girl was born to consanguineous parents. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as having Allgrove syndrome. Mutation analysis revealed a novel homozygous deletion of a single G, c.771delG, in exon 8 of the AAAS gene. This frame shift mutation was predicted to create a premature stop codon at locus 290, p.R258GfsX33, leading to a truncated and non-functioning aladin protein. Both the parents were heterozygous for the mutation. CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations and AAAS gene mutations analysis confirmed the diagnosis of Allgrove syndrome. Gene analysis indicated that this syndrome is an autosomal recessive inherent disorder. ALADIN is significant for the normal cell function. When compared with reported cases, it seems that there are no remarkable relation between gene mutation loci and clinical manifestations in Allgrove syndrome.

26595337|t|Molecular Analysis of Libyan Families with Allgrove Syndrome: Geographic Expansion of the Ancestral Mutation c.1331+1G&gt;A in North Africa.
26595337|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Allgrove syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by alacrima, achalasia, and adrenal insufficiency. It is caused by mutations of the AAAS gene located on chromosome 12q13 encoding the WD-repeat protein ALADIN. The c.1331+1G&gt;A mutation is one of the most common mutations described in the literature and was identified in Tunisian and Algerian populations. Herein, we describe the clinical and genetic profile of two families from Libya in North Africa associated with Allgrove syndrome. METHODS: Two unrelated families clinically diagnosed with Allgrove syndrome were evaluated for sequence variations in the AAAS gene. Blood samples were collected, and isolated DNA derived from the subjects was amplified. The entire sequence of the AAAS gene was analyzed by PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Molecular analysis revealed the major homozygous mutation (c.1331+1G&gt;A) in all patients. The presence of a major mutation in Tunisia, Algeria and, as discovered in this report, in Libya in patients with Allgrove syndrome suggests the existence of an ancestral mutation and a founder effect in North Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The findings allow for a fast genetic counseling in North African families with Allgrove syndrome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Allgrove syndrome in Libya.

3049657|t|Novel application of video image processing to biochemical and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
3049657|a|ALADIN (Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.) is an automated instrument that uses video imaging (computer-assisted guided video camera) for the determination of biochemical and antimicrobial susceptibility test reactions. This collaborative investigation compared video-generated results obtained with ALADIN with visually determined findings. Both approaches were used to view identical reactions. Overall agreement for biochemical and antimicrobial susceptibility tests was greater than 95%. This study demonstrates that video imaging is an acceptable approach for determining microbial responses to biochemical and antimicrobial agents and may provide, with appropriate computer modifications, more accurate and reproducible results than are possible by visual scrutiny.

12752575|t|Triple A syndrome: genotype-phenotype assessment.
12752575|a|The triple A or Allgrove syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease (MIM*231550) characterized by the triad of achalasia, alacrima and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency. Associated features of the syndrome are neurological and dermatological abnormalities. Until the discovery of the AAAS gene as the responsible gene in triple A syndrome, the diagnosis was based on characteristic clinical features. Here we present the clinical and molecular genetic data which demonstrated the marked phenotypic variability in three unrelated patients with triple A syndrome. The final diagnosis of triple A syndrome was confirmed by molecular analysis. In one patient with isolated achalasia, the diagnosis of triple A syndrome could only be made on the basis of the molecular genetic analysis of the AAAS gene. We therefore suggest that the diagnosis of triple A syndrome should be considered in patients who exhibit only one or two of the main symptoms (i.e. alacrima, achalasia or adrenal insufficiency). These patients require careful neurological investigation, and mutation analysis of the AAAS gene should be performed.

15654281|t|Association of chronic symptomatic neutropenia with the triple A syndrome.
15654281|a|Chronic neutropenia syndromes include distinct hereditary disorders with varying degrees of neutropenia. Among the more common inherited disorders associated with symptomatic neutropenia are cyclic neutropenia, severe congenital neutropenia (Kostmann disease), and Schwachman-Diamond syndrome. The authors describe a 17-year-old girl with triple A syndrome who developed a progressive decrease in the granulocyte count, finally resulting in long-standing neutropenia. Its probable pathogenesis may be related to dysfunction of ALADIN (the protein known to be mutated in triple A syndrome), resulting in abnormal nucleocytoplasmic transport of essential proteins, in myeloid precursor cells. Chronic neutropenia should therefore be considered among the clinical manifestations of triple A syndrome.

20529272|t|Ambient Assistive Technologies (AAT): socio-technology as a powerful tool for facing the inevitable sociodemographic challenges?
20529272|a|Due to the socio-demographic change in most developed western countries, elderly populations have been continuously increasing. Therefore, preventive and assistive systems that allow elderly people to independently live in their own homes as long as possible will become an economical if not ethical necessity. These respective technologies are being developed under the term "Ambient Assistive Technologies" (AAT). The EU-funded AAT-project Ambient Lighting Assistance for an Ageing Population (ALADIN) has established the long-term goal to create an adaptive system capable of improving the residential lighting conditions of single living elderly persons also aiming at supporting the preservation of their independence.Results of an earlier survey revealed that the elderly perceived their current lighting situation as satisfactory, whereas interviewers assessed in-house lighting as too dark and risk-laden. The overall results of ALADIN showed a significant increase in well-being from the baseline final testing with the new adaptive lighting system.Positive results for wellbeing and life quality suggest that the outcome effects may be attributed to the introduction of technology as well as to social contacts arising from participating in the study. The technological guidance of the study supervisors, in particular, may have produced a strong social reactivity effect that was first observed in the famous Hawthorne experiments in the 1930s. As older adults seem to benefit both from meaningful social contacts as well as assistive technologies, the question arises how assistive technology can be socially embedded to be able to maximize positive health effects. Therefore ethical guidelines for development and use of new assistive technologies for handicapped/older persons have to be developed and should be discussed with regard to their applicability in the context of AAT.

12717251|t|Achalasia of the cardia in Allgrove's (triple A) syndrome: histopathologic study of 10 cases.
12717251|a|Allgrove's syndrome, i.e., achalasia, addisonianism, alacrima (OMIM 231550) is an autosomal recessive disorder recently associated with the AAAS gene coding for the Aladin protein. However, the pathophysiology of achalasia in Allgrove's syndrome remains obscure. Here we investigated the histopathology of the cardia in Allgrove's syndrome. Myectomy specimens from 10 children with Allgrove's syndrome and four normal cardia were studied by routine staining and by immunohistochemistry for the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5, neuronal NO synthase, interstitial cells of Cajal, and CD3+ lymphocytes. In the normal cardia, myenteric ganglia, intramuscular nerve fibers, and interstitial cells of Cajal were numerous, whereas myenteric fibrosis and lymphocyte infiltrates were absent. In Allgrove's syndrome, fibrosis of the intermuscular plane was prevalent in all patients. Myenteric ganglia were absent, decreased, or apparently normal in 1 of 10, 8 of 10, and 1 of 10, respectively. Neuronal NO synthase was absent in 7 of 10 and decreased in 3 of 10, whereas interstitial cells of Cajal appeared normal in 7 of 10 and decreased in 3 of 10. Lymphocytes infiltrating the myenteric plexus were present in 6 of 10. Pyloromyectomy specimens available for six patients showed normal histopathologic features. In conclusion, the lack of neuronal NO synthase and fibrosis of the intermuscular plane can be linked to the defective cardia relaxation. Other features were less constant and may reflect the variability of disease expression and progression among patients with Allgrove's syndrome.

16264411|t|Familial occurrence of adrenocortical insufficiency in two brothers with Allgrove syndrome. A case report of 4A (Allgrove) syndrome with epilepsy and a new AAAS gene mutation.
16264411|a|Allgrove syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease with achalasia, alacrima, adrenocortical insufficiency, autonomic neuropathy and other neurological disturbances. A case of two brothers with Addison s disease from early childhood is presented. The younger brother with Addison disease died at the age of 5. The older brother was treated for adrenocortical insufficiency from the age 3, and then treated for achalasia and epilepsy from the age of 5. The patient is currently 26 years old and suffers from achalasia and adrenocortical insufficiency. He also suffers from alacrima, autonomic neuropathy, epilepsy and other damages of the central and peripheral nervous system. The clinical picture is typical for Allgrove or 4A syndrome, and the diagnosis was confirmed by means of molecular analysis of a new AAAS gene mutation.

21602994|t|Genetic evaluation of ALADIN gene in early-onset achalasia and alacrima patients.
21602994|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: ALADIN gene has been known to cause achalasia, alacrima, adrenal abnormalities and a progressive neurological syndrome. A considerable proportion of achalasia patients has been known to show alacrima (decreased secretion of tear). However, the genetic mechanism between achalasia and alacrima has not been defined yet. We postulated that ALADIN gene may be involved in the occurrence of early-onset achalasia; thus, we investigated the correlation of ALADIN gene in early-onset achalasia patients. METHODS: From 1989 to 2007, patients who were diagnosed as primary achalasia before age 35 were enrolled. All of the enrolled patients were asked for (1) blood sampling for DNA, (2) Shirmer test and (3) dysphagia questionnaires. RESULTS: The ALADIN gene in exon 1, 2, 10, 11 and 12 from 19 patients was investigated (M:F = 12:7). The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 27    5 (15-35) years old. Eight out of 19 (42%) showed alacrima by the positive Shirmer test. In spite of thorough exam in the genetic study, there was no definite abnormal genetic finding in this study. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of achalasia patients showed alacrima. Due to the limitation of this study, it is difficult to conclude that early-onset achalasia may have significant correlations with the ALADIN gene.

22824007|t|[Allgrove syndrome (triple A). Finding of a mutation not described in the AAAS gene].
22824007|a|Allgrove syndrome (triple A) is a rare autosomal recessive disease. The classic triad includes, congenital adrenal insufficiency due to ACTH resistance, achalasia of the cardia and alacrimia. Neurological abnormalities are associated with autonomic neuropathy, sensory and motor defects, deafness, mental retardation, Parkinsonism and dementia. The gene responsible is the ADRACALIN or AAAS encoding a protein called ALADIN. We report a case of a 19 year-old male, assessed when he was 10 years old in our department due to suspected storage disease. Mild mental and language retardation, hypernasal voice, sensory-motor neuropathy with autonomic involvement and signs of spastic paraparesis, alacrimia. gastroesophageal reflux, and achalasia. Molecular studies showed to mutations, the undescribed p.Tyr 19 Cys, and IVS14 +1 G.

19322026|t|Tissue-specific expression and subcellular localization of ALADIN, the absence of which causes human triple A syndrome.
19322026|a|Triple A syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the achalasia-addisonianism-alacrima syndrome (AAAS) gene which encodes a tryptophan aspartic acid (WD) repeat-containing protein named alacrima-achalasia-adrenal insufficiency neurologic disorder (ALADIN). Northern blot analysis shows that the 2.1 kb AAAS mRNA is expressed in various tissues with stronger expression in testis and pancreas. We show that human ALADIN is a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 60 kDa, and expressed in the adrenal gland, pituitary gland and pancreas. Furthermore, biochemical analysis using anti-ALADIN antibody supports the previous finding of the localization of ALADIN in the nuclear membrane. The mutations S544G and S544X show that alteration of S544 residue affects correct targeting of ALADIN to the nuclear membrane.

15690314|t|The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in a patient with Allgrove syndrome and a novel mutation in the ALADIN gene.
15690314|a|Allgrove syndrome is a genetic disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and characterized by a triad of adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrima. The gene affected by the mutation in patients with Allgrove syndrome is termed either AAAS or ALADIN (alacrima/achalasia/adrenal insufficiency/neurologic disorder). Adrenal insufficiency in patients with this disorder may develop as late as the third decade of life. We describe a 24-year-old female with Allgrove syndrome, in whom initial testing with 250 microg corticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test performed on 3 occasions produced normal serum cortisol values and results of the 1-microg ACTH stimulation tests performed on 6 occasions were conflicting. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia produced a nadir serum glucose value of 36 mg/dL without adequate serum cortisol stimulation, confirming presence of adrenal insufficiency. Gene sequencing identified 2 mutations in the triple A gene: an IVSC14 + 1 G to A mutation, which has been previously reported, and a novel R155P exon 6 mutation. We conclude that a novel R155P mutation in the ALADIN gene is associated with Allgrove syndrome and that insulin-induced hypoglycemia, rather than ACTH stimulation tests, should be used for accurate diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in this disorder.

20499090|t|Triple A syndrome: 32 years experience of a single centre (1977-2008).
20499090|a|Triple A syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by alacrima, achalasia, ACTH-resistant adrenal insufficiency, autonomic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Over the period 1977-2008 we evaluated ten subjects with the clinical diagnosis of triple A syndrome. Molecular analysis was performed in seven patients and revealed that all except one are compound heterozygotes for two mutations in the AAAS gene. Two novel mutations were detected: c.123+2T&gt;C resulted in splice defect while c.1261_1262insG mutation resulted in a truncated protein (p.V421fs), which most probably is not functional. Genotype-phenotype correlation could not be established. In all our patients, except one sibling of previously diagnosed brother and sister, genetic analysis was performed when at least two symptoms were present, usually alacrima and achalasia. Based on our experience, we recommend that in case of the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of triple A syndrome, adrenal function testing and molecular analysis should be performed. In all children with mutation in AAAS gene, regular follow up of adrenal function is necessary to avoid adrenal crisis and start substitution therapy as soon as adrenal insufficiency is noted.

22584989|t|Allgrove syndrome.
22584989|a|Allgrove syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It is also known as the 3A syndrome and characterised by the triad of achalasia, alacrima and adrenal insufficiency. The AAAS gene is encoded on chromosome 12q13. We report the case of a 23-year-old woman who presented at the hospital with adrenal crisis that was triggered by infection of the urinary system and gastrointestinal bleeding. She had a known diagnosis of achalasia for eight years, and ophthalmologic examination revealed alacrima. Based on our findings, the patient was diagnosed with Allgrove syndrome.

18953174|t|Late-onset triple A syndrome: a risk of overlooked or delayed diagnosis and management.
18953174|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: A 33-year-old man was referred for the first time to the Division of Neurology because of the presence and progression of neurological symptoms. Dysphagia, weakness, reduced tear production, and nasal speech were present. In order to point the attention of late-onset triple A syndrome we describe this case and review the literature. METHODS: Hormonal and biochemical evaluation, Schirmer test, tilt test and genetic testing for AAAS gene mutations. RESULTS: Late-onset triple A syndrome caused by a novel homozygous missense mutation in the AAAS gene (A167V in exon 6) was diagnosed at least 17 years after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: The association between typical signs and symptoms of triple A syndrome should suggest the diagnosis even if they manifest in adulthood. The diagnosis should be confirmed by Schirmer test, endocrine testing (both basal and dynamic), genetic analysis, and detailed gastroenterological and neurological evaluations. Awareness of the possible late onset of the disease and of diagnosis in adulthood is still poor among clinicians, the acquaintance with the disease is more common among pediatricians. The importance of an adequate multidisciplinary clinical approach, dynamic testing for early diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and periodical reassessment of adrenal function are emphasized.

17986825|t|Genetic disorders involving adrenal development.
17986825|a|The past decade has seen significant advances in our understanding of the genetic aetiology of several forms of adrenal failure that present in infancy or childhood. Several of these disorders affect adrenal development and are termed 'adrenal hypoplasia'. These conditions can be broadly divided into: (1) secondary forms of adrenal hypoplasia due to panhypopituitarism (e.g. HESX1, LHX4, SOX3) or abnormalities in ACTH synthesis (TPIT) or processing (e.g. POMC or PC1); (2) adrenal hypoplasia as part of an ACTH resistance syndrome [MC2R/ACTH receptor, MRAP, AAAS (triple A syndrome)], and (3) primary defects in the development of the adrenal gland itself (primary adrenal hypoplasia). Primary adrenal hypoplasia most commonly occurs in an X-linked form due to mutations in the nuclear receptor DAX1 (NR0B1) but can occur in a poorly understood recessive form or as part of the IMAGe (intrauterine growth retardation, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia, genitourinary anomalies) syndrome. Defining the molecular basis of these conditions can have significant clinical implications for management, counselling and presymptomatic diagnosis, as well as providing fascinating insight into normal and abnormal mechanisms of adrenal development in humans.

18615337|a|We report a 22-year-old female who presented with distal muscular atrophy and weakness in all limbs for two years. Reflexes were symmetrically brisk and electrodiagnostic studies were consistent with upper and lower motor neuron involvement. A diagnosis of juvenile ALS was considered. However, surgery for achalasia in childhood and identification of alacrima and adrenal insufficiency suggested Triple A syndrome accompanied by neurological symptoms. Sequencing of the AAAS gene identified compound heterozygous mutations confirming the clinical diagnosis and demonstrating that Triple A syndrome can mimic juvenile ALS.

15384895|t|Phenotypic heterogeneity in AAAS gene mutation.
15384895|a|We report the cases of two sibs of North African origin with AAAS gene mutation characterized by the heterogeneity of their phenotype. While an 8-y-old boy presented with acute adrenal insufficiency and mental retardation, the diagnosis was suggested by the clinical history of his 6-y-old sister who had symptomatic achalasia and chronic adrenal failure. CONCLUSION: Our observations corroborate the phenotypic heterogeneity reported in triple A syndrome, and underline the possibility of a variable intra-familial expression.

26461332|t|Transport of glutathione into the nucleus.
26461332|a|The tripeptide thiol glutathione (GSH) is present in the nucleus of plant and animal cells. However, the functions of GSH in the nucleus remain poorly characterised. GSH appears to become sequestered in the nucleus at the early stages of the cell cycle. As part of our search for proteins that may be involved in GSH transport into the nucleus, we studied the functions of the nucleoporin called Alacrima Achalasia aDrenal Insufficiency Neurologic disorder (ALADIN). ALADIN is encoded by the Achalasia-Addisonianism-Alacrimia (AAAS) gene in mammalian cells. Defects in ALADIN promote adrenal disorders and lead to the triple A syndrome in humans. The ALADIN protein localizes to the nuclear envelope in Arabidopsis thaliana and interacts with other components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We characterised the functions of the ALADIN protein in an Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertion knockout mutant, which shows slow growth compared to the wild type.

25554662|t|[Allgrove syndrome.]
25554662|a|BACKGROUND: Allgrove syndrome or "Triple A syndrome" involves adrenal insufficiency as a result of resistance to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), achalasia and alacrima, often associated with neurological signs. Herein, we report a new case of this rare genetic disease, which is of interest because of its dermatological mode of discovery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 4-year-old child, born to parents related by first-degree consanguinity, presented oral hyperpigmentation and diffused acquired melanoderma, as well as long-standing dry-eye syndrome. Laboratory tests confirmed low adrenal insufficiency. The combination of alacrima and adrenal insufficiency prompted screening for Allgrove syndrome, which was confirmed by genetic analysis showing homozygous c.1331+1G&gt;A mutation within intron  14 of the gene encoding for ALADIN protein. Both parents were heterozygous for the same mutation. Two years later, the onset of vomiting raised concerns about achalasia, which was confirmed by oesophageal manometry. The child received symptomatic treatment consisting of supplementary hydrocortisone and oesophageal dilatation. DISCUSSION: The present case serves as a reminder that Allgrove syndrome may be diagnosed by dermatologists. Therapy is cross-disciplinary, being based upon medical treatment for adrenal insufficiency with prescription of artificial tears in the event of alacrima. Achalasia is treated by oesophageal dilatation or by surgery.

15217518|t|Triple-A syndrome with prominent ophthalmic features and a novel mutation in the AAAS gene: a case report.
15217518|a|BACKGROUND: Triple-A syndrome (Allgrove syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, achalasia, and - occasionally - autonomic instability. Mutations have been found in the AAAS gene on 12q13. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 12 year-old boy with classic systemic features of triple-A syndrome and several prominent ophthalmic features, including: accommodative spasm, dry eye, superficial punctate keratopathy, and pupillary hypersensitivity to dilute pilocarpine. MRI showed small lacrimal glands bilaterally. DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments from the 16 exons of the AAAS gene revealed compound heterozygosity for a new, out-of-frame 5-bp deletion in exon 15, c1368-1372delGCTCA, and a previously-described nonsense mutation in exon 9, c938C&gt;T, R286X. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to known ophthalmic manifestations, triple-A syndrome can present with accommodative dysregulation and ocular signs of autonomic dysfunction.

12429595|t|Clinical and genetic characterization of families with triple A (Allgrove) syndrome.
12429595|a|Triple A (Allgrove) syndrome is characterized by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal abnormalities and a progressive neurological syndrome. Affected individuals have between two and four of these relatively common clinical problems; hence the diagnosis is often difficult in all but the classical presentation. The inheritance is autosomal recessive, and most cases of triple A have no family history. Using genetic linkage analysis in a small number of families, a locus on chromosome 12q13 was identified. The triple A gene was identified recently at this locus and called ALADIN (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency neurologic disorder). Mutations in this gene were reported in families from North Africa and Europe. The majority of mutations were homozygous. We have identified 20 families with between two and four of the clinical features associated with the triple A syndrome. Sequencing of the triple A gene revealed five families that had a total of nine compound heterozygous mutations, and one Portuguese family (previously published) had two homozygous mutations; these changes were spread throughout the triple A gene in exons 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 16, and the poly(A) tract. Those bearing mutations had the classical triple A syndrome of achalasia, alacrima, adrenal abnormalities and a progressive neurological syndrome. We identified a spectrum of associated neurological abnormalities in these cases, including pupil and cranial nerve abnormalities, frequent optic atrophy, autonomic neuropathy and upper and lower motor neurone signs including distal motor neuropathy and amyotrophy with severe selective ulnar nerve involvement. In these families, we have made genotype-phenotype correlations. Mutations in the triple A gene are thus an important cause of this clinically heterogeneous syndrome, and sequencing represents an important diagnostic investigation. Identifying further mutations and defining their phenotype along with functional protein analysis will help to characterize this neuroendocrine gene.

26246606|t|The nucleoporin ALADIN regulates Aurora A localization to ensure robust mitotic spindle formation.
26246606|a|The formation of the mitotic spindle is a complex process that requires massive cellular reorganization. Regulation by mitotic kinases controls this entire process. One of these mitotic controllers is Aurora A kinase, which is itself highly regulated. In this study, we show that the nuclear pore protein ALADIN is a novel spatial regulator of Aurora A. Without ALADIN, Aurora A spreads from centrosomes onto spindle microtubules, which affects the distribution of a subset of microtubule regulators and slows spindle assembly and chromosome alignment. ALADIN interacts with inactive Aurora A and is recruited to the spindle pole after Aurora A inhibition. Of interest, mutations in ALADIN cause triple A syndrome. We find that some of the mitotic phenotypes that we observe after ALADIN depletion also occur in cells from triple A syndrome patients, which raises the possibility that mitotic errors may underlie part of the etiology of this syndrome.

16885810|t|[Allgrove syndrome. Report on a family].
16885810|a|Triple A or Allgrove syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease with alacrima, achalasia, and ACTH-resistant adrenal insufficiency. It is usually associated with neurological disorders. Recently, mutations in the AAAS, a candidate gene mapped to chromosome 12q13, were identified. We report a family with seven affected siblings. All of them have signs of alacrima, four were operated on for achalasia, five have neurological abnormalities including cranial nerve abnormalities, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pyramidal syndrome, distal motor neuropathy, and amyotrophy, and two have adrenal insufficiency. Triple A syndrome should be considered in any young patient with alacrima.

16938764|t|Allgrove syndrome with features of familial dysautonomia: a novel mutation in the AAAS gene.
16938764|a|Allgrove syndrome (or triple-A syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency (glucocorticoid in the majority of cases) and autonomic/neurological abnormalities. This disease is now known to be caused by mutation in the AAAS gene located on chromosome 12q13. Diagnosis should be readily available when the full-blown features are there, but it becomes less apparent when presentation is atypical or in the evolving process. We present a brother and sister (12 and 19 y old, respectively) born to consanguineous parents of Palestinian origin with Allgrove syndrome. The index patient was erroneously diagnosed to be a case of familial dysautonomia before the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was made at the age of 7.5 y, while his elder sister had only alacrima from birth and developed achalasia at the age of 15 y. She started to develop early evidence of adrenal disease at the age of 19 y. Both of them had neuroautonomic dysfunction. The diagnosis of Allgrove syndrome was confirmed in these two patients by studying the gene mutation in the family. The sequencing of the AAAS gene in the two patients identified a novel homozygous mutation within intron 5 (IVS5+1G--&gt;A). Both parents as well as all three other children were heterozygous for the same mutation. CONCLUSION: These two cases illustrate the heterogenous nature and the intrafamilial phenotypic variability of Allgrove syndrome.

12530689|t|New insights into the molecular basis of the triple A syndrome.
12530689|a|The triple A syndrome (MIM*231550) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) resistant adrenal failure, achalasia, alacrima and a variety of neurological and dermatological features. Adrenal insufficiency usually presents in the first decade of life, however in some patients it may occur later in life or may even lack completely. Recently, we and others identified a novel gene on chromosome 12q13, designated AAAS (Achalasia-Addisonianism-Alacrima-Syndrome gene) which is mutated in patients with triple A syndrome. We investigated n=84 families including 111 patients with clinically suggested triple A syndrome and identified homozygous or compound heterozygous AAAS mutations in 78 families. Genotype/phenotype analyses revealed a highly variable occurrence, age of onset and severity of all clinical symptoms between patients with the same AAAS mutation. The obvious lack of a genotype/phenotype relationship is suggestive of modifying genes/factors which need to be determined. The AAAS protein function is unknown. With four WD repeats it belongs to the family of WD repeat-containing proteins which may exhibit a high degree of functional diversity. The subcellular localization of the protein and the determination of its putative binding partners will shed light on the role of the AAAS protein for the development and function of the adrenal gland and other neuroendocrine structures.

17755684|t|Can science survive in the modern age?
17755684|a|A recent newspaper account of the 1970 annual meeting of the AAAS was headlined, "Science's Blank Check Bounces." I am not, however, advocating that giving a "blank check" to science will solve all our problems. The discussion of science policy in the last three decades has too often confused necessary with sufficient conditions. A strong basic science is a necessary condition for a strong economy, a livable environment, and a tolerable society. But it is by no means a sufficient condition. That a vital science is an indispensable tool of human welfare in the present stage of evolution of man on the planet does not mean that it is the only tool or that it cannot also produce the opposite. Indeed, there seems almost to be a complementarity between the power for good and the power for evil inherent in science. Nuclear energy poses the possibility of nuclear holocaust, but is indispensable to a continuing supply of energy after fossil fuels run out. The computer threatens us with "big brother," but seems indispensable to the rational management of our complex social structures. Molecular genetics could be used for frightful purposes, but opens up the prospect of the final conquest of human disease and food supply. Drugs which control human behavior have opened up frightful possibilities for abuse and self-destruction, but they also offer the hope of conquest of mental illness. What I have referred to are really technologies, not science, but science is needed to use them wisely, although it will not guarantee their wise use. Although science cannot ask for a blank check, there is a part of it which must have the autonomy to "do its own thing"if it is to continue to serve society. How much of science should have this autonomy, and what sort of accountability should be required of it will be matters of continuing debate. Some accountability outside the scientific system itself is essential, as in any other human activity, but the degree of external accountability which is necessary will depend also on the success with which science maintains its own system of internal accountability, guaranteeing the intellectual excellence and integrity of its results. Although I do not believe scientists can be held accountable for the uses which society makes of the knowledge they produce, they do have an obligation to make clear the implications of this knowledge insofar as it is within their special intellectual competence to do so. However, I believe that the highest allegiance of science must continue to be to truth as defined by the validation procedures of the scientific process itself, and that the distortion of scientific results or the selective use of evidence for political purposes, no matter how worthy, is unforgivable insofar as it is presented cloaked by the authority and imputed objectivity of science. That science should have a measure of autonomy does not mean it cannot also respond to new social priorities. As in the past, new social missions can open up exciting new scientific questions, as fundamental as any generated by the internal workings of science. However, what is important is that no matter how much the broad strategy of science might be influenced by social priorities, the tactics should be largely governed by scientific criteria. Furthermore, it is essential that some science be supported and cultivated for its own sake alone. Here the primary criterion must be excellence as judged scientifically, that is, by internal standards. The fraction of the total technical effort that is supported in this way should have some degree of constancy over the long term. You are no doubt wondering what is the answer to the question posed by the title of this article. I cannot give a definite answer one way or the other. The threats to the integrity of science, both from within and from without, are probably greater than at any time in the past, because science is much more a part of the total social and political process, no longer the semihobby of a few dedicated and somewhat eccentric individuals. But I am an optimist. I do not think that the scientific enterprise is going down the drain. It will change, as science has always changed. It will respond to new social priorities, but, like an organism responding to disease, it will develop antibodies which will fight and finally contain excessive control by external criteria, and in fact will transform these external pressures into new opportunities and new fundamental fields of inquiry. But I could be wrong!

26519721|t|Novel Mutations in a Patient with Triple A Syndrome.
26519721|a|BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome (Allgrove syndrome), a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by adrenal insufficiency, achalasia cardia and alacrimia. It is caused by mutations in AAAS gene which encodes a protein called ALADIN. CASE CHARACTERISTICS: 8-year-old boy who presented with hypoglycemic seizures, dysphagia, dry eyes and hyperpigmentation. Investigations confirmed achalasia cardia and adrenal insufficiency. Sequencing of AAAS gene revealed two novel mutations in compound heterozygous state (c.1101delG/ c.1310_1311delCT). OUTCOME: Patient was managed with hydrocortisone and artificial tears. MESSAGE: Sequencing analysis should be done to confirm the diagnosis of clinically suspected Triple A syndrome.

6781066|t|Innovation and evaluation.
6781066|a|Social, medical, and technological innovations are discussed, first with reference to historical examples and then with modern studies. I show the need for evaluating both the innovations themselves and the research processes leading to them. I suggest some kinds of research that need to be carried out if we are to continue to have a vigorous program of scientific and technological innovation. Finally, I explain the new initiative by the AAAS in science and engineering education.

21656342|t|Neurological features in adult Triple-A (Allgrove) syndrome.
21656342|a|Triple-A or Allgrove syndrome is a rare multisystem disease classically associated with esophageal achalasia, adrenal insufficiency and alacrima. Here, we describe the poorly understood neurological characteristics often associated with this condition, through the clinical and electrophysiological analysis of eight patients. All patients were genetically confirmed and had a mutation in the ALADIN gene. They all displayed a classical picture of Triple-A syndrome: all suffered from achalasia and alacrima and half of them from adrenal insufficiency. However, all harbored a neurological picture characterized by a recognizable pattern of peripheral neuropathy. Other neurological features included cognitive deficits, pyramidal syndrome, cerebellar dysfunction, dysautonomia, neuro-ophthalmological signs and bulbar and facial symptoms. This neurological picture was prominent in all patients and misled the initial diagnosis in six of them, which had a late onset. We then review the previous neurological reports of this disease, to improve the understanding of this rare condition. Diagnosis of late-onset Triple-A syndrome is difficult when the clinical picture is mainly neurological and when endocrine or gastrointestinal signs are minor. The characteristics of the peripheral neuropathy, among other neurological signs, can be of help.

12700313|t|Allgrove or 4 "A" syndrome: an autosomal recessive syndrome causing multisystem neurological disease.
12700313|a|Allgrove's or "4 A" syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition with alacrima, achalasia, autonomic disturbance, and ACTH insensitivity among other features. Recent studies have identified mutations in the AAAS, a candidate gene on chromosome 12q13 in such patients. Manifestations in adult patients are rarely reported. The syndrome usually presents during the first decade of life with dysphagia or severe (occasionally fatal) hypoglycaemic or hypotensive attacks, related to adrenocortical insufficiency. Onset of adrenal insufficiency or other features may be delayed to adulthood. In contrast with paediatric patients, adult patients with Allgrove's syndrome may present with multisystem neurological disease; the childhood history of achalasia or alacrima may be overlooked. The authors describe two families with two affected siblings and a further unrelated patient with typical clinical features of Allgrove's syndrome, who exhibit signs of multisystem neurological disease including hyperreflexia, muscle wasting, dysarthria, ataxia, optic atrophy, and intellectual impairment. None of the cases have developed adrenal insufficiency but all have progressive neurological disability. Autonomic dysfunction was a significant cause of morbidity in two cases. The three index cases represent the longest described follow up of Allgrove's syndrome into adulthood. It is speculated that they represent a subgroup of patients who follow an often undiagnosed chronic neurological course. Recognition of the syndrome presenting in adult life permits treatment of unrecognised autonomic dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency and dysphagia, and appropriate genetic advice.

12548737|t|Chromosomal fragility in patients with triple A syndrome.
12548737|a|Triple A syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by alacrima, achalasia, and adrenal insufficiency. Previous studies have shown that the triple A gene (AAAS) maps to chromosomal band 12q13. Mutations in the AAAS gene have been identified in triple A syndrome patients; however, the function of this gene is still obscure. We used classical and high-resolution chromosome analyses along with chromosome painting and DNA sequencing to study patients with triple A syndrome. We observed abnormalities in the heterochromatic region of chromosome 9 that included chromatid breaks, chromosome breaks, whole chromosome arm loss, and marker chromosomes, which occurred at unusually high frequencies in affected patients and heterozygotes. Our study raises the possibility of an association between chromosomal fragility in band 9q12 and triple A syndrome. Further investigation is necessary to understand the biologic basis of this finding in the context of triple A syndrome.

19703420|t|The transmembrane nucleoporin NDC1 is required for targeting of ALADIN to nuclear pore complexes.
19703420|a|NDC1 is a transmembrane nucleoporin that is required for NPC assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport. We show here that NDC1 directly interacts with the nucleoporin ALADIN, mutations of which are responsible for triple-A syndrome, and that this interaction is required for targeting of ALADIN to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Furthermore, we show that NDC1 is required for selective nuclear import. Our findings suggest that NDC1-mediated localization of ALADIN to NPCs is essential for selective nuclear protein import, and that abrogation of the interaction between ALADIN and NDC1 may be important for the development of triple-A syndrome.

21565631|t|Mutation spectra of the AAAS gene in Iranian families with Allgrove Syndrome.
21565631|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Allgrove (OMIM#231550) or Triple-A syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of familial adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrima. Approximately one-half of all patients with Triple-A syndrome have been shown to have mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13, which results in loss or non-function of the encoded protein. METHODS: Five unrelated families clinically diagnosed with Allgrove Syndrome were evaluated for sequence variations in the AAAS gene. Blood samples were collected after informed and written consent was obtained. Isolated DNA derived from subjects was amplified using intronic primers. The entire sequence of the AAAS gene including regulatory region, coding regions and exon-intron boundaries were analyzed for any alteration by PCR and direct sequencing. RESULTS: In six probands of five families, four previously reported and two novel mutations were identified. Two heterozygote and homozygote mutations in exon 9 and the regulatory region, respectively, were detected in one of the probands. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of Triple-A syndrome from an Iranian population. Collectively, our study findings indicate that mutations scattered across the AAAS gene and upstream regulation elements. Various ethnic groups should develop a mutation database for their own rare genetic disorders. However, mutation databases should initially screen common mutated alleles. Our families present the typical triad of symptoms and the mutation spectrum is similar to the other population studied. Further study is required for phenotype-genotype correlation in the Iranian population.

8443591|a|The helix-stabilizing effects of repeating pairs of Asp-Arg and Glu-Arg residues have been characterized using a peptide system of the same design used earlier to study Glu-Lys (Marqusee, S. _ Baldwin, R.L., 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 8898-8902) and Asp-Lys ion pairs (Marqusee, S. _ Baldwin, R.L., 1990, In Protein Folding [Gierasch, L.M. _ King, J., Eds.], pp. 85-94, AAAS, Washington, D.C.). The consequences of breaking ion pair and charge-helix dipole interactions by titration to pH 2 have been compared with the results of screening these interactions with NaCl at pH 7.0 and pH 2.5. The four peptides in each set contain three pairs of acidic (A) and basic (B) residues spaced either i, i + 4 or i, i + 3 apart. In one peptide of each kind the pairwise order of residues is AB, with the charges oriented favorably to the helix macrodipole, and in the other peptide the order is BA. The results are as follows: (1) Remarkably, both Asp-Arg and Glu-Arg peptides show the same pattern of helix stabilization at pH 7.0 found earlier for Glu-Lys and Asp-Lys peptides: i + 4 AB &gt; i + 4 BA approximately i + 3 AB &gt; i + 3 BA. (2) The ion pairs and charge-helix dipole interactions cannot be cleanly separated, but the results suggest that both interactions make important contributions to helix stability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

22172444|t|The role of transthoracic echocardiography in the diagnosis and management of acute type A aortic syndrome.
22172444|a|BACKGROUND: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) has been traditionally considered inadequate for the diagnosis of acute type A aortic syndrome (AAAS). In the last decade, high-resolution probes and harmonic imaging have been implemented in new echocardiographic systems. However, studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of TTE for the identification of AAAS in large populations using modern ultrasound technology are lacking. METHODS: The diagnostic value of harmonic imaging TTE was assessed in 270 consecutive patients with suspected AAAS in whom TTE was the initial diagnostic test. RESULTS: Acute type A aortic syndrome was diagnosed in 67 patients and excluded in 203 patients (disease prevalence 25%). Sixty-two patients had a classic acute type A aortic dissection, and 5, an acute type A intramural hematoma. Image quality achieved was considered optimal in 244 patients (90%). In the whole study population, TTE had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of AAAS of 87%, 91%, 75%, and 95%, respectively. When evaluating only patients with optimal image quality, these values increased to 97%, 100%, 100%, and 99%, respectively. Forty-seven patients with clear-cut evidence of AAAS were transferred immediately to the operative room, where transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis obtained by TTE in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Transthoracic echocardiography is a useful imaging modality for the diagnosis of classic acute type A aortic dissection. It cannot be used as the sole screening technique for detecting AAAS, but in the light of the predictive values observed, patients with optimal image quality and clear-cut diagnosis of AAAS should proceed to the operative room, whereas in patients with negative or indeterminate studies, other imaging techniques are needed to refine the diagnosis.

18172684|t|Three siblings with triple A syndrome with a novel frameshift mutation in the AAAS gene and a review of 17 independent patients with the frequent p.Ser263Pro mutation.
18172684|a|The triple A syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, achalasia, and impairment of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system functions. The disease is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the nuclear pore protein ALADIN. In the present study, we report three siblings with triple A syndrome caused by a compound heterozygous mutation consisting of a novel Val421 frameshift mutation in exon 14 and a previously described Ser236Pro (T&gt;C transition) missense mutation in exon 8. The second mutation is one of the most frequent mutations in the AAAS gene, occurring in 17 independent patients from different countries. With haplotype analysis, we demonstrate a founder effect for at least 13 of the 17 patients. We conclude that, although very helpful in establishing the final diagnosis of triple A syndrome, DNA analysis is not useful for the prediction of the clinical expression and outcome of the disorder. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate the correlation between genotype and clinical phenotype in the triple A syndrome.

19078797|t|A novel DNA sequence variation in the first genetically confirmed allgrove syndrome in iran.
19078797|a|Allgrove syndrome or triple-A syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. Affected patients may also present with a constellation of central and peripheral nervous system manifestations. The gene for Allgrove syndrome (ALADIN) is located on chromosome 12q13. Here we report a 23-year-old man with alacrimia, achalasia, optic atrophy and progressive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like presentations. Sequencing of ALADIN gene showed a novel 6-bp sequence variant that the patient was homozygous and his father was heterozygous for the defect. A probable mechanism of action of this newly diagnosed missense mutation would be to cause abnormal splicing of the ALADIN gene.

12008750|t|Analysis of the AAAS gene in a Japanese patient with triple A syndrome.
12008750|a|Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. It has recently been reported that this syndrome is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene. In the present study, we analyzed the AAAS gene in a Japanese patient with triple A syndrome. The patient was a Japanese girl previously reported by Hirose et al. (J Jpn Pediatr Soc 102: 912-915, 1998). The parents of the patient were first cousins. The patient was confirmed to have alacrima and isolated glucocorticoid deficiency at the age of 2 years. She later developed achalasia of the cardia, and was diagnosed as having triple A syndrome. The AAAS gene was amplified by the PCR method, and the PCR products were directly sequenced. The patient was homozygous for a novel nonsense mutation Q237X, changing codon 237 encoding Gln (CAA) to a stop codon (TAA). The parents were heterozygous for the Q237X mutation. The AAAS gene encodes a protein of 546 amino acids, ALADIN. The Q237X mutation is predicted to result in a truncated and presumably non-functioning ALADIN protein, thus causing the clinically manifest syndrome in the patient. To our knowledge, this is the first report on AAAS gene mutations in Japan.

18175081|t|Case report of adult-onset Allgrove syndrome.
18175081|a|Allgrove syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by childhood onset, alacrima, oesophageal achalasia, adrenocortical insufficiency, neurological and occasionally autonomic involvement. Although the disease has been associated with mutations in the ALADIN gene on chromosome 12q13, it is genetically heterogeneous. The case we report is interesting because of its onset in adulthood, long duration of disease and prominent neurological dysfunctions. After the onset of neurological abnormalities the diagnosis went unrecognised for years until the patient presented for evaluation of dysphagia. The presence of achalasia with dysphagia, adrenal insufficiency, reduced tear production, optic atrophy and peripheral motor-sensory neuropathy with axonal loss led us to clinically diagnose Allgrove syndrome even though a genetic study showed no mutations in the ALADIN gene exons. The case we report shares many clinical features with Allgrove syndrome and, even with the limitations of a single case, underlines the variability in this syndrome and the need for appropriate investigations along with a multidisciplinary approach.

22538409|t|Long-term clinical follow-up and molecular genetic findings in eight patients with triple A syndrome.
22538409|a|The triple A syndrome (Allgrove syndrome, OMIM #231550) is caused by autosomal recessively inherited mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the nuclear pore protein ALADIN. This multisystemic disease is characterised by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency and neurological impairment. We analyse long-term clinical follow-up and results of sequencing of the AAAS gene in eight patients with triple A syndrome aged from 2 to 35 years. At the time of diagnosis, all patients presented with alacrima, neurological dysfunction, dermatological abnormalities, seven of them with adrenal insufficiency and five of them with achalasia. Sequencing of the AAAS gene identified the p.S263P mutation in five of eight patients, supporting the hypothesis that this mutation is a founder mutation in Slavic population. One of the patients is homozygous for the p.S263P mutation, two are compound heterozygous for the p.S263P and the p.G14fs mutation, two are compound heterozygous for the p.S263Pro mutation and p.S296Y mutation, two are compound heterozygous for the p.G14fs and the p.Q387X mutations and one is homozygous for the p.Q387X mutation. In the course of the follow-up time of 4-29 years, progression of existing and appearance of new symptoms developed. Although severe, many of these symptoms presented in all six young adult patients are often overlooked or neglected: postural hypotension with blurred vision and syncope, hyposalivation resulting with complete edentulosis, talocrular contractures with permanent walking difficulties and erectile dysfunction in male patients. Triple A syndrome is a progressive debilitating disorder which may seriously affect quality of life and even be life-threatening in patients with severe neurological impairment. CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up of patients with triple A syndrome revealed a variety of the clinical features involving many systems. Progressive natural course of the disease may seriously affect quality of life and even be life-threatening in patients with severe neurological impairment.

27133709|t|Clinical and Genetic Characterization of 26 Tunisian Patients with Allgrove Syndrome.
27133709|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Allgrove syndrome is characterized by achalasia, alacrima, and adrenal insufficiency as well as being associated with progressive neurological signs. This is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the AAAS gene located on chromosome 12q13. The AAAS gene encodes a protein of 546 amino acids, ALADIN. Mutations in this genwere reported in families from North Africa and Europe. Our objective is to conduct a clinical, molecular and genetic study of 26 Tunisian patients with Allgrove syndrome. METHODS: We report 26 Tunisian patients with between two and four clinical features associated with Allgrove syndrome. Blood samples were collected and isolated DNA derived from subjects was amplified. The entire sequence of the AAAS gene was analyzed by PCR and sequencing. PCR-RFLP method was performed to identify the frequent mutations found. RESULTS: Sequencing of the AAAS gene revealed a major homozygous mutation (c.1331+1G&gt;A) in 25 patients and R286X mutation in one patient. The presence of a major mutation in several unrelated affected individuals suggests the presence of a founder effect in Tunisia and allows for a fast and targeted molecular diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: We created an easy and rapid molecular enzymatic protocol based on PCR-RFLP using MvaI restriction enzyme that directly targets this major mutation and can be used for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling for Tunisian families at risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first major series report of Allgrove syndrome in Tunisia.

22682306|t|The influence of climate change on stomatal ozone flux to a mountain Norway spruce forest.
22682306|a|Daily stomatal ozone flux to a mountain Norway spruce forest stand at the Bily Kriz experimental site in the Beskydy Mts. (Czech Republic) was modelled using a multiplicative model during the 2009 growing season. The multiplicative model was run with meteorological data for the growing season 2009 and ALADIN-CLIMATE/CZ model data for the 2030 growing season. The exceedance of the flux-based critical level of O(3) (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose) might be lower for Norway spruce at the Bily Kriz experimental site in a future climate (around 2030), due to increased stomatal closure induced by climate change, even when taking into account increased tropospheric background O(3) concentration. In contrast, exceedance of the concentration-based critical level (AOT40) of O(3) will increase with the projected increase in background O(3) concentration. Ozone concentration and stomatal flux of ozone significantly decreased NEP under both present and future climatic conditions, especially under high intensities of solar radiation.

25781531|t|Triple A syndrome with a novel indel mutation in the AAAS gene and delayed puberty.
25781531|a|UNASSIGNED: Triple A syndrome, formerly known as Allgrove syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized clinically by adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, achalasia, and neurological abnormalities. We report a 17-year-old boy presented to the endocrine clinic with delayed puberty and a 4-year's history of fatigue and muscle weakness. He had achalasia, alacrima, and skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation. Hormonal assessment revealed isolated glucocorticoid deficiency. Clinical diagnosis of triple A syndrome was confirmed by sequencing the entire coding region including exon-intron boundaries of the AAAS gene. Analysis revealed a homozygous novel indel mutation encompassing intron 7 to intron 10 of the gene (g.16166_17813delinsTGAGGCCTGCTG; NG_016775). This is the first report of triple A syndrome in Jordan with a novel indel mutation and presenting with delayed puberty.

19855093|t|Deficiency of ferritin heavy-chain nuclear import in triple a syndrome implies nuclear oxidative damage as the primary disease mechanism.
19855093|a|Triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ACTH-resistant adrenal failure, alacrima, achalasia, and progressive neurological manifestations. The majority of cases are associated with mutations in the AAAS gene, which encodes a novel, 60-kDa WD-repeat nuclear pore protein, alacrima-achalasia-adrenal insufficiency neurological disorder (ALADIN) of unknown function. Our aim was to elucidate the functional role of ALADIN by determining its interacting protein partners using the bacterial two-hybrid (B2-H) technique. Nonidentical cDNA fragments were identified from both a HeLa S-3 cell and human cerebellar cDNA library that encoded the full-length ferritin heavy chain protein (FTH1). This interaction was confirmed by both co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies. Immunoblotting showed that fibroblasts from triple A patients (with known AAAS mutations) lack nuclear FTH1, suggesting that the nuclear translocation of FTH1 is defective. Cells transfected with FTH1 and visualized by confocal microscopy had very little nuclear FTH1, but when cotransfected with AAAS, FTH1 is readily visible in the nuclei. Therefore, FTH1 nuclear translocation is enhanced when ALADIN is coexpressed in these cells. In addition to its well known iron storage role, FTH1 has been shown to protect the nucleus from oxidative damage. Apoptosis of neuronal cells induced by hydrogen peroxide was significantly reduced by transfection of AAAS or by FTH1 or maximally by both genes together. Taken together, this work offers a plausible mechanism for the progressive clinical features of triple A syndrome.

25247238|t|A Tunisian Patient with Two Rare Syndromes: Triple A Syndrome and Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism.
25247238|a|Background/Aims: The coexistence of triple A syndrome (AAAS) and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) has so far not been reported in the literature. This study aimed to characterize at the clinical and genetic level one patient presenting an association of AAAS and CHH in order to identify causal mutations. Methods: Clinical and endocrinal investigations were performed and followed by mutational screening of candidate genes. Results: At the age of 18, the patient presented sexual infantilism, a micropenis and gynecomastia. No mutation was revealed in GnRHR, TACR3/TAC3, PROK2/PROKR2 and PROP1 genes, except a homozygous intronic variation (c.244 + 128C&gt;T; dbSNP: rs350129) in the KISS1R gene, which is likely nondeleterious. A homozygous splice-donor site mutation (IVS14 + 1G&gt;A) was found in the AAAS gene. This mutation, responsible for AAAS, is a founder mutation in North Africa. Conclusion: This is the first report on a Tunisian patient with the coexistence of AAAS and CHH. The diagnosis of CHH should be taken in consideration in patients with Allgrove syndrome and who carry the IVS14 + 1G&gt;A mutation as this might challenge appropriate genetic counseling.    2014 S.

16479006|t|Mice lacking the nuclear pore complex protein ALADIN show female infertility but fail to develop a phenotype resembling human triple A syndrome.
16479006|a|Triple A syndrome is a human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, alacrima, and neurological abnormalities affecting the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems. In humans, this disease is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene, which encodes ALADIN, a protein that belongs to the family of WD-repeat proteins and localizes to nuclear pore complexes. To analyze the function of the gene in the context of the whole organism and in an attempt to obtain an animal model for human triple A syndrome, we generated mice lacking a functional Aaas gene. The Aaas-/- animals were found to be externally indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates, although their body weight was on the average lower than that of wild-type mice. Histological analysis of various tissues failed to reveal any differences between Aaas-/- and wild-type mice. Aaas-/- mice exhibit unexpectedly mild abnormal behavior and only minor neurological deficits. Our data show that the lack of ALADIN in mice does not lead to a triple A syndrome-like disease. Thus, in mice either the function of ALADIN differs from that in humans, its loss can be readily compensated for, or additional factors, such as environmental conditions or genetic modifiers, contribute to the disease.

20674935|t|Adult or late-onset triple A syndrome: case report and literature review.
20674935|a|Triple A syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene encoding ALADIN, leading to achalasia, alacrima and addisonism. Neurologic manifestations of the disease include motor neuron disease-like presentations, motor-sensory or autonomic neuropathy, optic atrophy, cerebellar ataxia, Parkinsonism, and mild dementia. We report a 60-year-old Japanese man with triple A syndrome. He was born to non-consanguineous parents. He underwent a surgical operation for achalasia at age 40, and thereafter, he developed a slowly progressive gait disturbance. Neurological examinations at age 60 revealed limb muscle wasting and weakness with pyramidal tract signs, distal-dominant sensory disturbance, optic atrophy, and autonomic dysfunction. Alacrima was detected using Schirmer test. All of these features were consistent with typical triple A syndrome. He lacked adrenal insufficiency that is frequently observed in patients with the classic phenotype of triple A syndrome. His sural nerve biopsy showed a moderate loss of myelinated fibers and hypomyelination. He was homozygous for a missense mutation, p.R155H, in the disease-causing gene, AAAS. Seven patients with genetically-confirmed, adult or late-onset triple A syndrome, including ours, have been reported to date. All the patients showed upper and lower motor neuron signs (100%), while sensory disturbance (29%) and autonomic dysfunction (57%) were less frequent. Careful assessment for alacrima followed by molecular genetic analysis of AAAS should be considered in patients who show a combined phenotype of motor neuron disease and sensory/autonomic disturbance, even in elderly patients.

19782045|t|The nuclear pore complex protein ALADIN is anchored via NDC1 but not via POM121 and GP210 in the nuclear envelope.
19782045|a|The nuclear pore complex (NPC) consists of approximately 30 different proteins and provides the only sites for macromolecular transport between cytoplasm and nucleus. ALADIN was discovered as a new member of the NPC. Mutations in ALADIN are known to cause triple A syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, and achalasia. The function and exact location of the nucleoporin ALADIN within the NPC multiprotein complex is still unclear. Using a siRNA-based approach we downregulated the three known membrane integrated nucleoporins NDC1, GP210, and POM121 in stably expressing GFP-ALADIN HeLa cells. We identified NDC1 but not GP210 and POM121 as the main anchor of ALADIN within the NPC. Solely the depletion of NDC1 caused mislocalization of ALADIN. Vice versa, the depletion of ALADIN led also to disappearance of NDC1 at the NPC. However, the downregulation of two further membrane-integral nucleoporins GP210 and POM121 had no effect on ALADIN localization. Furthermore, we could show a direct association of NDC1 and ALADIN in NPCs by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. Based on our findings we conclude that ALADIN is anchored in the nuclear envelope via NDC1 and that this interaction gets lost, if ALADIN is mutated. The loss of integration of ALADIN in the NPC is a main pathogenetic aspect for the development of the triple A syndrome and suggests that the interaction between ALADIN and NDC1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.

20931227|t|Two siblings with triple A syndrome and novel mutation presenting as hereditary polyneuropathy.
20931227|a|The clinical and molecular data on triple A syndrome in two siblings (girl 3.5  years and boy 5.5  years at presentation) with early onset of neurological dysfunction are described. Both patients showed delayed developmental milestones and neurological dysfunctions (motor and sensory demyelinating neuropathy, marked hyperreflexia, calves hypothrophy, pes cavus, gait disturbance) in early childhood, when erroneously diagnosed with hereditary polyneuropathy, most likely Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. After a severe adrenal crisis in the younger sister at the age of 3  years, the older brother aged 5.5  years was also evaluated and latent adrenal insufficiency was discovered. As both of the siblings had alacrima, hyperkeratosis of palms, cutis anserina, and nasal speech, diagnosis of triple A syndrome was considered. Sequencing of the AAAS gene detected a compound heterozygous mutation consisting of a novel mutation p.Ser296Tyr (c.887C&gt;A) in exon 9 and a previously described p.Ser263Pro (c.787T&gt;C) missense mutation in exon 8 in both siblings. In conclusion, triple A syndrome should be considered in patients presenting with early neurological dysfunction and developmental delay. Alacrima as the earliest and most consistent clinical sign should be investigated by Schirmer test. Patients should be regularly tested for adrenal dysfunction to prevent life-threatening adrenal crises.

17911039|t|An Alu-mediated rearrangement causing a 3.2kb deletion and a novel two base pair deletion in AAAS gene as the cause of triple A syndrome.
17911039|a|Triple A syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from deleterious mutations in the AAAS gene located on chromosome 12q13. Typical clinical presentation of this syndrome includes adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrima. A 10-year-old female was diagnosed with Triple A syndrome at the age of 1 year. Initial analysis of the AAAS gene revealed apparently homozygosity for a novel 2bp deletion in exon 1. The father of the patient was heterozygous for this mutation but the mother and the maternal grandparents were apparently homozygous for the wild-type. Further studies demonstrated that the patient carried an intragenic 3.2kb deletion within both 5' and 3' breakpoints located within Alu-repeats. The deletion includes 5'-flanking region, exon 1, intron 1, exon 2, and part of intron 2 sequences of the AAAS gene. This Alu-mediated deletion was inherited from her mother and maternal grandmother. This is the first report that Alu-mediated rearrangement in conjunction with a novel two-bp deletion of the AAAS gene is a cause of Triple A syndrome. The results of our study lead to the hypothesis that an Alu-mediated mechanism may be responsible for large alterations in the AAAS gene. We also stress the importance of studying the family in genetic recessive diseases, such as Triple A syndrome, to avoid incorrect diagnosis and to provide accurate genetic counseling.

27414811|t|Splicing Defects in the AAAS Gene Leading to both Exon Skipping and Partial Intron Retention in a Tunisian Patient with Allgrove Syndrome.
27414811|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Allgrove syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, and alacrima. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene. A major splice site mutation c.1331+1G&gt;A was found previously in North African families affected by Allgrove syndrome. In this study, we analyzed in vivo and in silico the effect of this mutation on the splicing process. METHODS: Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, sequencing and bioinformatics tools, we analyzed all transcripts produced by the AAAS gene containing this splice site mutation. RESULTS: The altered splicing of mRNA produces two aberrant transcripts: one with exon 14 skipping, the other with concurrent exon 14 skipping and retention of 99 bp of intron 14, both outcomes resulting in frameshifts with a new stop codon generation in the untranslated region of the last exon. Using in silico bioinformatics tools, we demonstrated that this mutation abolishes the splice donor site of exon 14 and activates a new intronic cryptic splice site in intron 14. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a single splicing mutation affects the AAAS transcripts and consequently the ALADIN protein structure and function.

23073554|t|The genetic basis of triple A (Allgrove) syndrome in a Greek family.
23073554|a|Triple A (or Allgrove) syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Patients typically suffer from chronic adrenal insufficiency due to resistance to ACTH (Addison's disease), achalasia of the cardia, and defective tear formation (alacrima). The syndrome is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene which encodes the protein ALADIN, a constituent of eukaryotic nuclear pore complexes. The multi-systemic nature and variable manifestations of the triple A syndrome often confound its diagnosis and limit our understanding of its exact pathogenesis. We performed mutational screening of the AAAS gene in a Greek family of four individuals, including an affected propositus with typical symptoms of late-onset triple A syndrome. Our results are consistent with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance within the family, caused by a functional c.43C&gt;A mutation in exon 1 of the AAAS gene. All members of the family were also homozygous for a silent c.855C&gt;T nucleotide change within exon 9 of the AAAS gene, representing a common single nucleotide polymorphism. The compromising c.43C&gt;A mutation is predicted to cause a p.Gln15Lys amino acid substitution in the ALADIN protein. However, it has been suggested that the functional impact of this mutation may be more severe, causing a shift in the reading frame of AAAS gene via formation of an aberrant premature donor splice site within exon 1. We propose that mutational analysis of the AAAS gene should be considered in adult patients with one or more clinical signs of the disease, as diagnosis of late-onset cases can be ambiguous.

20687490|t|Triple-A syndrome.
20687490|a|Triple-A syndrome is characterized by triad of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency, alacrimia and achalasia cardia. It is a rare disease and inherited by autosomal recessive pattern. Allgrove syndrome is characterized by mutation(s) in AAAS gene, located on chromosome 12q13, that codes for ALADIN protein. Most mutations produce a truncated protein, although missense and point-mutations have also been reported. Some patients with Triple-A syndrome may not have mutations in AAAS gene; in those there is no specific genotype-phenotype correlation. Although alacrimia is not the usual presenting manifestation, probably it is the earliest and most consistent feature. Achalasia cardia and adrenal insufficiency are the early and usual presenting manifestations. Neurological features appear at later age and autonomic manifestations are the most common neurological disorder. Polyneuropathy, amyotrophy, optic atrophy are the other common neurological problems. Alacrimia is diagnosed by Schirmer's test while ahalasia cardia and adrenal insufficiency are best diagnosed by esophageal monometry and ACTH stimulated cortisol levels respectively. Alacrimia is treated with artificial tears while achalasia cardia with either pneumatic dilatation or Heller's myotomy. Adrenal insufficiency is treated with glucocorticoid and if necessary mineralocorticoid replacement.

16937455|t|Mutations of the AAAS gene in an Indian family with Allgrove's syndrome.
16937455|a|The triple A or Allgrove's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of achalasia cardia, alacrima and ACTH resistant adrenocortical insufficiency. Mutations of the Achalasia-Addisonianism-Alacrima-Syndrome (AAAS) gene on chromosome 12q13 are associated with this syndrome. We report an Indian family where two siblings were homozygous for a known mutation of the AAAS gene and presented with the classical triad of symptoms. The mother and the brother were heterozygous and asymptomatic. The affected siblings had iron deficiency anemia and the younger sister had pes cavus and palmoplantar keratosis. Neurological symptoms were absent in both affected children. Recognition of this syndrome can lead to early treatment of adrenal insufficency and genetic counselling.

23825130|t|Deficiency of ALADIN impairs redox homeostasis in human adrenal cells and inhibits steroidogenesis.
23825130|a|Triple A syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive cause of adrenal failure. Additional features include alacrima, achalasia of the esophageal cardia, and progressive neurodegenerative disease. The AAAS gene product is the nuclear pore complex protein alacrima-achalasia-adrenal insufficiency neurological disorder (ALADIN), of unknown function. Triple A syndrome patient dermal fibroblasts appear to be more sensitive to oxidative stress than wild-type fibroblasts. To provide an adrenal and neuronal-specific disease model, we established AAAS-gene knockdown in H295R human adrenocortical tumor cells and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells by lentiviral short hairpin RNA transduction. AAAS-knockdown significantly reduced cell viability in H295R cells. This effect was exacerbated by hydrogen peroxide treatment and improved by application of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. An imbalance in redox homeostasis after AAAS knockdown was further suggested in the H295R cells by a decrease in the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione. AAAS-knockdown SH-SY5Y cells were also hypersensitive to oxidative stress and responded to antioxidant treatment. A further impact on function was observed in the AAAS-knockdown H295R cells with reduced expression of key components of the steroidogenic pathway, including steroidogenic acute regulatory and P450c11b protein expression. Importantly a significant reduction in cortisol production was demonstrated with AAAS knockdown, which was partially reversed with N-acetylcysteine treatment. CONCLUSION: Our in vitro data in AAAS-knockdown adrenal and neuronal cells not only corroborates previous studies implicating oxidative stress in this disorder but also provides further insights into the pathogenic mechanisms in triple A syndrome.

16789645|a|We report on the first Chinese patient with triple-A syndrome, who presented at 22 months with status epilepticus secondary to hyponatraemia and hypoglycaemia. Subsequent endocrine investigations confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency and aldosterone deficiency. In the presence of achalasia and alacrima, this patient satisfies the diagnostic criteria of triple-A syndrome. Further molecular testing detected compound heterozygous mutations in the AAAS gene: a c.580C --&gt; T transition in exon 7 and a c.771delG single nucleotide deletion in exon 8. Testing of parents and brother confirmed their heterozygous carrier status.

14646395|t|Three children with triple A syndrome due to a mutation (R478X) in the AAAS gene.
14646395|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the phenotype and genotype of 3 unrelated children with triple A syndrome from southern Turkey. METHODS: The coding sequence of the AAAS gene was sequenced including exon-intron boundaries. Haplotype analysis using markers from AAAS region was performed in order to assess potential founder effects. RESULTS: In all 3 patients, the identical nonsense mutation (R478X) in exon 16 of the AAAS gene was identified. The patients who may be distantly related appeared phenotypically similar with the classical triad of the triple A syndrome (adrenal insufficiency, alacrima and achalasia) with dermatological manifestations while lacking neurological features except for mild mental retardation. CONCLUSION: The R478X mutation tends to result in a rather severe phenotype although genotype-phenotype relationships cannot be drawn due to the small number of patients.

24301417|t|Effects of group intervention on moral development of distressed youths in Israel.
24301417|a|The effects of a positive peer culture (PPC) program [H. H. Vorrath and L. K. Brendatro (1974),Positive Peer Culture, Aladin, Chicago, Illinois] upon the moral development of "youths in distress" within the framework of streetcorner gangs was measured. This group was compared with two control groups, one related and the other unrelated to the participants. Moraldevelopment measures used in this study-resistance to temptation, moral stage, feeling after offense, punishment, and confession [A. Ziv (1976), Measuring aspects of morality.J. Moral Educ. 5: 189-201]-indicated a positive effect upon the participants, and for some moral indices, on their friends' moral development (the related group). The potential effect upon moral development of such a program and the possibility of working with representatives of youth-in-distress groups in order to produce change are stressed.

25788865|t|Astrocytoma-associated antigens - IL13Ra2, Fra-1, and EphA2 as potential markers to monitor the status of tumour-derived cell cultures in vitro.
25788865|a|BACKGROUND: The molecular heterogeneity of high-grade astrocytomas underlies the difficulties in the development of representative and valuable in vitro experimental models for their studies. The purpose of our study was to estimate the value of astrocytoma-associated antigens (AAAs) - IL13Ra2, Fra-1, EphA2 - and the most common molecular aberrations typical for astrocytomas as potential markers to screen the status of tumour-derived cell cultures in vitro. METHODS: The tumour-derived cell cultures were established from high-grade astrocytomas. The expression analyses of the tested genes were performed via semi-quantitative real-time PCR and subsequently verified by immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical technique. The analyses of molecular aberrations at DNA level included gene dosage status evaluation based on real-time PCR, sequencing analysis, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) assay. RESULTS: The expression analyses based on semi-quantitative real-time PCR showed that in the final stage of culture the expression level of all tested AAAs was significantly higher or at least comparable to that of primary tumours; however, two expression patterns were observed during cell culture establishment. Analysis at the single cell level via immunocytochemistry also demonstrated an increase of the level of tested proteins and/or selection of tumour cell populations strongly positive for AAAs vs. other cell types including admixed non-tumoural cells. Confrontation of AAA expression data with the results of molecular analyses at DNA level seems to support the latter, revealing that the expression pattern of astrocytoma-associated antigens in tumour-derived cells in subsequent stages of culture is convergent with changes in the molecular profile of examined cell populations. CONCLUSIONS: The consistency of the obtained results seems to support the use of the selected AAAs, in particular IL13Ra2 and Fra-1, as tools facilitating the establishment of tumour-derived cultures. However, the intratumoural heterogeneity of high-grade astrocytomas may require further detailed characterisation of the molecular profile of a tumour in order to evaluate the value of the experimental model in relation to the individual context of particular studies.

14693424|t|The nuclear pore complex: disease associations and functional correlations.
14693424|a|Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are large protein structures spanning the double membrane of the eukaryotic nucleus that serve as sites for translocation of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The vertebrate NPC has recently been found to comprise approximately 30 distinct proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. Studies over the past several years have demonstrated that individual nucleoporins have unique roles in regulating NPC function and the nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins and RNAs. The unique functions of individual nucleoporins have been made most clear through their associations with specific human diseases. Here, we highlight the relationships between individual nucleoporins and disease, with particular emphasis given to ALADIN, a nucleoporin linked to a genetically heritable human disease known as triple A syndrome.

20140543|t|Frovatriptan in the practice of office-based neurologists/pain therapists: Results of postmarketing surveillance study ALADIN.
20140543|a|INTRODUCTION: Large postmarketing surveillance (PMS) studies have demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of frovatriptan for treatment of acute migraine in patients attending general practitioners (GPs). The aim of the ALADIN (Allegro Anwendung durch interessierte Neurologen [Allegro application by interested neurologists]) PMS study was to evaluate frovatriptan in patients attending neurologists or pain therapists. METHODS: Patients fulfilling International Headache Society criteria for migraine, with or without aura, were enrolled. Patients completed an attack diary, including details of the attack, time to onset of action of frovatriptan, and recurrence of headache. Physicians completed a case report form detailing prior and actual migraine treatment. Frovatriptan 2.5 mg was administered for up to three consecutive attacks. RESULTS: In total, 2160 patients were enrolled and data were obtained for 5831 attacks. Patients attending neurologists had more frequent attacks and longer history of migraine compared with those attending GPs. Median time to frovatriptan onset of action was 40 min and time to freedom from headache 70 min. An average of 1.2 frovatriptan tablets was required per attack, and mean additional analgesic use was 0.13. Recurrent headache occurred in 13.6%-15.5% of patients. Physicians as well as patients judged frovatriptan onset and duration of action as at least "good" in approximately 80% of attacks. A similar number judged the efficacy of frovatriptan against headache as "better" than previous treatment. The study drug was generally well tolerated. The frequency of adverse events was 0.6%. CONCLUSION: Frovatriptan, with fast onset of action and low rate of headache recurrence, was efficacious and well accepted by migraineurs attending neurologists or pain therapists. Approximately 80% of patients wished to continue migraine treatment with frovatriptan.

16543750|t|A novel AAAS gene mutation (p.R194X) in a patient with triple A syndrome.
16543750|a|OBJECTIVE: The clinical and molecular data of a patient with triple A syndrome are reported. PATIENT: A 21-year-old male who was diagnosed for adrenal insufficiency at the age of 2 years after a severe attack of adrenal crisis. At the age of 4 years, achalasia and alacrima were diagnosed. Puberty started at the age of 17 years. At the same time, symptoms of central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction were noted. Later on, at the age of 20 years, a bone age delay of 6 years and severe osteoporosis was diagnosed. RESULTS: A compound heterozygous AAAS mutation consisting of two mutations was found: a C &gt; T transition in exon 7 resulting in a change of arginine at amino acid position 194 into a stop codon (Arg194X) at one allele, and a C &gt; T transition in exon 12 resulting in a change of glutamine at amino acid position 387 into a stop codon (Gln387X) on the other allele. CONCLUSION: The mutation in exon 7 (p.R194X) of the AAAS gene is a novel mutation which has not been found in any other family so far, whereas the second was already found in some other families. This case adds to the clinical and molecular spectrum of triple A syndrome and may provide a new insight into the functions of AAAS gene.

15516781|t|Two cases of Allgrove syndrome with mutations in the AAAS gene.
15516781|a|Allgrove syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. This syndrome, also known as triple A syndrome, is now known to be caused by mutations in the AAAS gene. In the present study, we report two new patients of Allgrove syndrome with mutations in the AAAS gene. Patient 1 was a 22-year-old Japanese woman, born to consanguineous parents. She was confirmed to have adrenal insufficiency at the age of 3 years and 6 months. She developed alacrima and bilateral optic nerve atrophy at the age of 8 years. She had been noticed to have dysphagia. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as having Allgrove syndrome. Mutation analysis revealed a novel homozygous point mutation in exon 7 of her AAAS gene, changing codon 194 encoding Arg (CGA) to a stop codon (TGA) (R194X). Patient 2 was a 7-year-old Japanese boy, born to consanguineous parents. At the age of 1 year, he was noticed to be unable to produce tears. He was confirmed to have adrenal insufficiency, mental retardation and spastic diplegia at the age of 5 years and 4 months. He was tentatively diagnosed as having Allgrove syndrome, although he has never complained of dysphasia. Mutation analysis revealed a homozygous point mutation in exon 4 of his AAAS gene, changing codon 119 encoding Arg (CGA) to a stop codon (TGA) (R119X). Both of the R119X and R194X mutations are predicted to result in truncated and non-functioning ALADIN proteins, and thus the diagnosis of Allgrove syndrome was confirmed by the mutation analyses. These findings indicate that there exist significant clinical variability and mutational heterogeneities in Japanese patients with this syndrome.

23315990|t|Changes in differential gene expression in fibroblast cells from patients with triple A syndrome under oxidative stress.
23315990|a|The triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the AAAS gene, which encodes the nucleoporin ALADIN. Recently it was shown that ALADIN plays a role in the import of different factors into the nucleus, which prevent the cell from DNA damage and consecutive cell death under oxidative stress. In order to investigate the changes in differential gene expression in ALADIN-deficient or mutated cells under oxidative stress we used fibroblast cell cultures of triple A syndrome patients and compared these to controls. Analysis of 84 genes, which are associated with oxidative stress and antioxidant defense, showed that 7 genes were significantly and differentially regulated, namely BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19kD-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), 24-dehydrocholesterol reduc-tase (DHCR24), dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), nudix-type motif 1 (NUDT1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and scavenger receptor class A, member 3 (SCARA3). Whereas in control cells the expression of DHCR24, FOXM1, NUDT1, and SCARA3 was decreased after paraquat treatment, the expression did not change significantly in patient cells. However, the basal expression of SCARA3 and BNIP3 was significantly higher in patient cells than in controls whereas PTGS2 was less expressed. Furthermore, after paraquat treatment the expression of BNIP3, DUSP1, and PTGS2 was significantly increased in control cells while in patient cells the increase of DUSP1 and PTGS2 expression was significantly reduced. With this work we confirm that cells of triple A patients show an altered induction or downregulation of genes associated with oxidative stress and antioxidant defense.

18628786|t|Axonal neuropathy with unusual pattern of amyotrophy and alacrima associated with a novel AAAS mutation p.Leu430Phe.
18628786|a|The triple A syndrome is caused by autosomal recessively inherited mutations in the AAAS gene and is characterized by achalasia, alacrima and adrenal insufficiency as well as progressive neurological impairment. We report on a 14-year-old girl with slowly progressive axonal motor neuropathy with conspicuous muscle wasting of hypothenars and calves as well as alacrima. The mutation analysis of the AAAS gene revealed a compound heterozygous mutation: a c.251G&gt;A mutation in exon 2 that had been reported previously, and a novel c.1288C&gt;T mutation in exon 14. At the transcriptional level, the c.251G&gt;A transition results in an aberrant splicing and decay of this RNA strand so that the particular clinical picture results from the novel c.1288C&gt;T, (p.Leu430Phe, L430F) mutation in a hemizygous form. With transfection experiments, we demonstrate that GFP-ALADIN(L430F) correctly localizes to nuclear pore complexes. Therefore, we conclude that this point mutation impairs ALADIN function at the nuclear pore.

11701718|t|Spectrum of mutations of the AAAS gene in Allgrove syndrome: lack of mutations in six kindreds with isolated resistance to corticotropin.
11701718|a|Familial glucocorticoid deficiency due to corticotropin (ACTH) resistance consists of two distinct genetic syndromes that are both inherited as autosomal recessive traits: isolated ACTH resistance (iACTHR), which may be caused by inactivating mutations of the ACTH receptor (the MC2R gene) or mutations in an as yet unknown gene(s), and Allgrove syndrome (AS). The latter is also known as triple-A syndrome (MIM 231550). In three large cohorts of AS kindreds, the disease has been mapped to chromosome 12; most recently, mutations in the AAAS gene on 12q13 were found in these AS families. AAAS codes for the WD-repeat containing ALADIN (for alacrima-achalasia-adrenal insufficiency-neurologic disorder) protein. We investigated families with iACTHR (n = 4) and AS (n = 6) and a Bedouin family with ACTHR and a known defect of the TSH receptor. Four AS families were of mixed extraction from Puerto Rico (PR); most of the remaining six families were Caucasian families from North America (NA). Sequencing analysis found no MC2R genetic defects in any of the kindreds. No iACTHR kindreds, but all of AS families, had AAAS mutations. The previously reported IVS14+1G--&gt;A splice donor mutation was found in all PR families, apparently due to a founder effect; one NA kindred was heterozygous for this mutation. In the latter family, long-range PCR failed to identify a deletion or other rearrangements of the AAAS gene. No other heterozygote or transmitting parent had any phenotype that could be considered part of AS. The IVS14+1G--&gt;A mutation results in a premature termination of the predicted protein; although it was present in all PR families (in the homozygote state in three of them), there was substantial clinical variation between them. One PR family also carried a novel splice donor mutation of the AAAS gene in exon 11, IVS11+1G--&gt;A; the proband was a compound heterozygote. A novel point mutation, 43C--&gt;A(Gln15Lys), in exon 1 of the AAAS gene was identified in the homozygote state in a Canadian AS kindred with a milder AS phenotype. The predicted amino acid substitution in this family is located in a sequence that may participate in the preservation of stability of ALADIN beta-strands, whereas the splicing mutation in exon 11 may interfere with the formation of WD repeats in this molecule. We conclude that 1) AAAS does not appear to be frequently mutated in families with iACTHR; 2) AAAS is mutated in AS families from PR (that had previously been mapped to 12q13) and NA; and, 3) there is significant clinical variability between patients with the same AAAS defect.

16098009|t|Genotypic heterogeneity and clinical phenotype in triple A syndrome: a review of the NIH experience 2000-2005.
16098009|a|Triple A syndrome (AAAS, OMIM#231550) is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, alacrima, neurodegeneration and autonomic dysfunction. Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 have been reported in several subjects with AAAS. Over the last 5 years, we have evaluated six subjects with the clinical diagnosis of AAAS. Three subjects had mutations in the AAAS gene-- including one novel mutation (IVS8+1 G&gt;A)-- and a broad spectrum of clinical presentations. However, three subjects with classic AAAS did not have mutations in the AAAS gene on both alleles. This finding supports the notion of genetic heterogeneity for this disorder, although other genetic mechanisms cannot be excluded.

26622478|t|Identification of AAAS gene mutation in Allgrove syndrome: A report of three cases.
26622478|a|UNASSIGNED: Allgrove syndrome (AS) is an autosomal recessive congenital disease, caused by mutations in the AAAS gene, and is characterized by the triad of Addison's disease, achalasia and alacrima. The present study describes three newly diagnosed cases of AS, in which genetic analysis of the AAAS gene was used to identify AAAS gene mutations, to enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of AS in the Chinese population. Two of the cases exhibited homozygous mutations of c.771delG (p.Arg258GlyfsX33) in exon 8 and one case exhibited a homozygous mutation of c.1366C&gt;T (p.Q456X) in exon 15. A review of the current literature suggests that the AAAS c.771delG mutation has only been reported in the Chinese population. Genetic analysis of the AAAS gene in Chinese AS patients at a young age may facilitate an earlier diagnosis and the timely initiation of the appropriate treatment, ultimately improving the patient outcome.

15666842|t|The triple A syndrome is due to mutations in ALADIN, a novel member of the nuclear pore complex.
15666842|a|The triple A syndrome (MIM#231550) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) resistant adrenal failure, achalasia, alacrima, and a variety of neurological and dermatological features. The triple A syndrome is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene, which encodes a protein known as ALADIN (ALacrima Achalasia aDrenal Insufficiency Neurologic disorder). ALADIN is a new WD-repeat protein that has no significant homology to any previously identified WD-repeat protein. It has been shown that it colocalizes with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), a finding that strongly suggests an involvement of ALADIN in nucleocytoplasmic transport. An investigation of 110 families with triple A syndrome disclosed mutation hot spots including Q15K (exon 1), and S293P (exon 8), which occur in 17 and 21 families from different geographical regions, respectively. The variable phenotype of all patients cannot be correlated with the localization and the nature of the ALADIN mutations. Thus, modifying genes/factors may be involved in the progression of this neurodegenerative disease. The lack of AAAS mutations in eight patients and negative linkage to chromosome 12q13 in three families are suggestive of genetic heterogeneity. To examine the cellular localization of ALADIN mutants causing triple A syndrome, we investigated nine different ALADIN-mutants: 2 nonsense (W84X, Q456X), 2 frameshift (F157fsX171, G397fsX414) and 5 point mutations (Q15K, L25P, H160R, S263P, L381R) by transfection experiments with green fluorescence protein. Mutants were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, but also found in the nucleus indicating that ALADIN is essential for NPC targeting. To investigate physiological functions of ALADIN in vivo, we generated and analysed Aaas-/- knockout mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Surprisingly, required animals lack any gross abnormality in adrenal and nervous system function. Further studies have to investigate the role of ALADIN at NPCs and to identify interacting proteins. Functional analyses of ALADIN may permit further understanding of its role for adrenocortical function and neurodevelopment.

17853339|t|Dysphagia due to triple A syndrome: successful treatment of achalasia by balloon dilatation.
17853339|a|Triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder which is characterized by alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, and achalasia. We report on a 14-year old girl with dysphagia, regurgitation, and vomiting since 5 years. At the age of five years an Addison crisis was diagnosed and cortisone substitution was initiated. In addition, the patient had episodes of conjunctivitis. Severe esophagitis and candida infection were diagnosed by esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and treated with omeprazole and fluconazole. The esophageal barium swallow was typical for achalasia. Medical treatment of achalasia with oral nifedipine resulted only in a partial and temporal improvement. But after seven balloon dilatations dysphagia and nocturnal coughing improved clearly and a remarkable gain of weight could be seen. Direct sequencing showed a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 11 of the AAAS gene leading to truncation at position 342 of the 546 amino acid protein. CONCLUSION: Triple A syndrome has to be considered in patients with dysphagia. In our patient, the absence of tears since birth followed by adrenal insufficiency were early signs of the triple A syndrome. Balloon dilatation of the esophago-gastric junction is an effective treatment, which can avoid surgical interventions.

22269647|t|Triple A syndrome in a patient with genetic growth hormone insensitivity: phenotypic effects of two genetic disorders.
22269647|a|BACKGROUND: Primary growth hormone insensitivity (GHI) and triple A syndrome are rare autosomal recessive disorders. CASE REPORT: The patient, a 12-year-old boy from consanguineous parents, was referred for short stature at the age of 7 years (height: -5.4 SD score). He had low serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF binding protein 3 and a blunted IGF-I response to recombinant human GH; molecular analysis of the GH receptor disclosed a homozygous A(-1)&gt;G(-1) at the 5' pseudoexon 6   splice site. Recombinant IGF-I therapy (mecasermin, Increlex  , twice daily) initiated at the age of 9 years resulted in an increase of height velocity (HV) from 4.0 to 9.5 cm/year. At the age of 10.5 years, he presented with asthenia, anorexia, weight loss, a decrease in HV and very low cortisol levels; adrenal insufficiency was confirmed and glucocorticoid therapy was initiated. Subsequent peripheral motor neuropathy, achalasia and alacrima raised the suspicion of triple A syndrome, which was confirmed by the presence of a homozygous R194X mutation in the AAAS gene. CONCLUSION: This unusual combination of diseases, to our knowledge, has not been reported to date. Although the patient responded to recombinant IGF-I therapy for GHI, we hypothesize that the treatment could have had an inhibitory effect on 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity, thereby reducing the availability of cortisol and precipitating adrenal insufficiency.

20200814|t|Two patients with an identical novel mutation in the AAAS gene and similar phenotype of triple A (Allgrove) syndrome.
20200814|a|BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by three cardinal symptoms: adrenal insufficiency due to ACTH insensitivity, achalasia and alacrima. Various progressive neurological abnormalities and skin changes have been described in association with the syndrome. The disease is caused by mutation in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13. AAAS encodes a protein named ALADIN which is part of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The mislocalization of mutated ALADIN proteins in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus results in an impaired protein function. Phenotypes of previously reported patients with triple A syndrome varied within and between affected families so that no genotype-phenotype could be established. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in two unrelated patients, their parents and one sister. AAAS coding sequences including exon-intron boundaries were amplified and sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencing machine. PATIENTS: We present two unrelated Swiss patients with triple A syndrome demonstrating similar phenotypic characteristics. Both showed a progression of the disease presenting with adrenal insufficiency and alacrima in early childhood. At the age between 30-40 years they developed symptomatic achalasia. The pattern and severity of progressive neurological and autonomic dysfunction was comparable. In both patients molecular genetic analysis revealed an identical novel homozygous mutation (c.618delC, p.Ser207fs) in the AAAS gene. CONCLUSION: Recent genotype/phenotype studies showed a marked inter- and intrafamiliar variability in triple A syndrome. Here we present a rather tight genotype/phenotype correlation in two unrelated patients carrying the identical novel p.Ser207fs mutation in the AAAS gene.

22791940|t|Pathogenesis of achalasia cardia.
22791940|a|Achalasia cardia is one of the common causes of motor dysphagia. Though the disease was first described more than 300 years ago, exact pathogenesis of this condition still remains enigmatic. Pathophysiologically, achalasia cardia is caused by loss of inhibitory ganglion in the myenteric plexus of the esophagus. In the initial stage, degeneration of inhibitory nerves in the esophagus results in unopposed action of excitatory neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, resulting in high amplitude non-peristaltic contractions (vigorous achalasia); progressive loss of cholinergic neurons over time results in dilation and low amplitude simultaneous contractions in the esophageal body (classic achalasia). Since the initial description, several studies have attempted to explore initiating agents that may cause the disease, such as viral infection, other environmental factors, autoimmunity, and genetic factors. Though Chagas disease, which mimics achalasia, is caused by an infective agent, available evidence suggests that infection may not be an independent cause of primary achalasia. A genetic basis for achalasia is supported by reports showing occurrence of disease in monozygotic twins, siblings and other first-degree relatives and occurrence in association with other genetic diseases such as Down's syndrome and Parkinson's disease. Polymorphisms in genes encoding for nitric oxide synthase, receptors for vasoactive intestinal peptide, interleukin 23 and the ALADIN gene have been reported. However, studies on larger numbers of patients and controls from different ethnic groups are needed before definite conclusions can be obtained. Currently, the disease is believed to be multi-factorial, with autoimmune mechanisms triggered by infection in a genetically predisposed individual leading to degeneration of inhibitory ganglia in the wall of the esophagus.

23327820|t|Clinical and genetic characterization of a Chinese patient with triple A syndrome and novel compound heterozygous mutations in the AAAS gene.
23327820|a|BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by adrenal failure, alacrima, achalasia, and progressive neurologic symptoms. AIM: Here, we describe the clinical and genetic characteristics in a Chinese patient with novel mutations in the AAAS gene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical and radiologic characteristics of the patient have been fully described. The coding sequences, including exon-intron boundaries, were amplified from genomic DNA and were sequenced. RESULTS: The clinical and radiologic findings of the patient are fully described. The sequencing of the AAAS gene detected two novel heterozygous mutations, including a c.577C&gt;T, p.Gln193X in exon 7 and a novel frameshift mutation c.1062_1063insAC, p.Ser355fsX416 in exon 11. The testing of parents confirmed their heterozygous carrier status. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant clinical variability and mutational heterogeneities in Asian patients with this syndrome. DNA analysis is very helpful in establishing the final diagnosis of triple A syndrome, although its implication in the prediction of clinical expression and the outcome of the disorder is limited.

12730363|t|The nuclear pore complex protein ALADIN is mislocalized in triple A syndrome.
12730363|a|Triple A syndrome is a human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an unusual array of tissue-specific defects. Triple A syndrome arises from mutations in a WD-repeat protein of unknown function called ALADIN (also termed Adracalin or AAAS). We showed previously that ALADIN localizes to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), large multiprotein assemblies that are the sole sites of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Here, we present evidence indicating that NPC targeting is essential for the function of ALADIN. Characterization of mutant ALADIN proteins from triple A patients revealed a striking effect of these mutations on NPC targeting. A variety of disease-associated missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations failed to localize to NPCs and were found predominantly in the cytoplasm. Microscopic analysis of cells from a triple A patient revealed no morphological abnormalities of the nuclei, nuclear envelopes, or NPCs. Importantly, these findings indicate that defects in NPC function, rather than structure, give rise to triple A syndrome. We propose that ALADIN plays a cell type-specific role in regulating nucleocytoplasmic transport and that this function is essential for the proper maintenance andor development of certain tissues. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of triple A syndrome and may lead to unique insights into the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport in adrenal function and neurodevelopment.

18426811|t|Heterogeneity in the molecular basis of ACTH resistance syndrome.
18426811|a|OBJECTIVE: ACTH resistance syndromes are rare, autosomal, and genetically heterogeneous diseases that include familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) and triple A syndrome. FGD has been shown to segregate with mutations in the gene coding for ACTH receptor (MC2R) or melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP), whereas mutations in the triple A syndrome (AAAS, Allgrove syndrome) gene have been found in segregation with triple A syndrome. We describe the clinical findings and molecular analysis of MC2R, MRAP, and AAAS genes in five Brazilian patients with ACTH resistance syndrome. DESIGN AND METHODS: Genomic DNA from patients and their unaffected relatives was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes and amplified by PCR, followed by automated sequencing. Functional analysis was carried out using Y6 cells expressing wild-type and mutant MC2R. RESULTS: All five patients showed low cortisol and elevated plasma ACTH levels. One patient had achalasia and alacrima, besides the symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. The molecular analysis of FGD patients revealed a novel p.Gly116Val mutation in the MC2R gene in one patient and p.Met1Ile mutation in the MRAP gene in another patient. Expression of p.Gly116Val MC2R mutant in Y6 cells revealed that this variant failed to stimulate cAMP production. The analysis of the AAAS gene in the patient with triple A syndrome showed a novel g.782_783delTG deletion. The molecular analysis of DNA from other two patients showed no mutation in MC2R, MRAP, or AAAS gene. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the molecular basis of ACTH resistance syndrome is heterogeneous, segregating with genes coding for proteins involved with ACTH receptor signaling/expression or adrenal gland development and other unknown genes.

11159947|t|Triple A syndrome is caused by mutations in AAAS, a new WD-repeat protein gene.
11159947|a|The triple A syndrome (MIM 231550) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. The frequent association with a variety of neurological features may result in a severely disabling disease. We previously mapped the syndrome to a 6 cM interval on chromosome 12q13 and have now refined the critical region to 0 cM between KRT8 and D12S1651. Overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences of a high resolution BAC/P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) contig were screened for gene content and a novel gene encoding a 546 amino acid polypeptide was identified. In nine triple A syndrome patients eight different homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations were found in this gene, most of them leading to a truncated protein suggesting loss of function. RNA blotting experiments revealed marked expression in neuroendocrine and gastrointestinal structures, which are predominantly affected in triple A syndrome, supporting the hypothesis that mutations in this triple A syndrome gene (AAAS) are responsible for the disease. The predicted protein belongs to the family of WD repeat-containing proteins which exhibit a high degree of functional diversity including regulation of signal transduction, RNA processing and transcription.

10183214|t|Bringing together housing and aging services: the experiences of area agencies on aging.
10183214|a|Aging organizations generally do not consider housing issues as an important priority. Research suggests that lack of knowledge may be a significant barrier that prevents their involvement in housing-related activities. This article reports on a study that examined the extent and level of AAAs' involvement in housing-related activities with particular attention to instances of cooperation and collaboration between AAAs and housing agencies. It employed a national survey of Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). Further, since the lack of knowledge about housing is a barrier to involvement, the study examined the role of a housing specialist in motivating higher levels of activity. Though there is no single overall indicator of activities to do with housing, the results indicate a range of activities pursued by AAAs. The presence of a housing specialist within the AAA generally served as a catalyst, motivating higher levels of this kind of activity. The importance of housing as a component of a comprehensive long-term care continuum is also discussed.

23800107|t|Triple A (Allgrove) syndrome: an unusual association with syringomyelia.
23800107|a|Triple A (Allgrove) syndrome was first described by Allgrove in 1978 in two pairs of siblings. Since then, about 100 cases have been reported, all of them displaying an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Clinical picture is characterized by achalasia, alacrimia and ACTH-resistant adrenal failure. A progressive neurological syndrome including central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system impairment, and mild mental retardation is often associated. The triple A syndrome gene, designated AAAS, is localized on chromosome 12q13. It consists of 16 exons, encoding for a 546 aminoacid protein called ALADIN (Alacrimia-Achalasia-aDrenal Insufficiency Neurologic disorder).

11062474|t|Mutant WD-repeat protein in triple-A syndrome.
11062474|a|Triple-A syndrome (MIM 231550; also known as Allgrove syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia of the oesophageal cardia and alacrima. Whereas several lines of evidence indicate that triple-A syndrome results from the abnormal development of the autonomic nervous system, late-onset progressive neurological symptoms (including cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and mild dementia) suggest that the central nervous system may be involved in the disease as well. Using fine-mapping based on linkage disequilibrium in North African inbred families, we identified a short ancestral haplotype on chromosome 12q13 (&lt;1 cM), sequenced a BAC contig encompassing the triple-A minimal region and identified a novel gene (AAAS) encoding a protein of 547 amino acids that is mutant in affected individuals. We found five homozygous truncating mutations in unrelated patients and ascribed the founder effect in North African families to a single splice-donor site mutation that occurred more than 2,400 years ago. The predicted product of AAAS, ALADIN (for alacrima-achalasia-adrenal insufficiency neurologic disorder), belongs to the WD-repeat family of regulatory proteins, indicating a new disease mechanism involved in triple-A syndrome. The expression of the gene in both neuroendocrine and cerebral structures points to a role in the normal development of the peripheral and central nervous systems.

21626165|t|New ophthalmic features in a family with triple A syndrome.
21626165|a|We report three subjects of a Greek family affected by triple A syndrome (AAAS). All patients underwent complete ophthalmic examination, full-field electroretinogram (ERG), visual evoked responses (VER), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and molecular analysis of the AAA gene. All patients had alacrima. In two of them, the proband and her brother, bilateral optic atrophy was assessed and the VER were pathological. In contrast, the ERG was normal. OCT showed a decrease of the retinal nerve fiber layer. The third case had only alacrima and the optic nerves were normal. The molecular genetic study of the AAAS gene revealed a homozygous missense mutation p.Ala167Val. To our knowledge this is the first time a family with AAAS has been investigated using OCT, VER and ERG. Our findings illustrate that the retina is not involved. There is also an interfamilial variability concerning the involvement of the optic nerves.

23972263|t|Effect of longacting somatostatin analogue on kidney and cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ALADIN): a randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial.
23972263|a|BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease slowly progresses to end-stage renal disease and has no effective therapy. A pilot study suggested that the somatostatin analogue octreotide longacting release (LAR) could be nephroprotective in this context. We aimed to assess the effect of 3 years of octreotide-LAR treatment on kidney and cyst growth and renal function decline in participants with this disorder. METHODS: We did an academic, multicentre, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in five hospitals in Italy. Adult (&gt;18 years) patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 40 mL/min per 1  73 m(2) or higher were randomly assigned (central allocation by phone with a computerised list, 1:1 ratio, stratified by centre, block size four and eight) to 3 year treatment with two 20 mg intramuscular injections of octreotide-LAR (n=40) or 0  9% sodium chloride solution (n=39) every 28 days. Study physicians and nurses were aware of the allocated group; participants and outcome assessors were masked to allocation. The primary endpoint was change in total kidney volume (TKV), measured by MRI, at 1 year and 3 year follow-up. Analyses were by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00309283. FINDINGS: Recruitment was between April 27, 2006, and May 12, 2008. 38 patients in the octreotide-LAR group and 37 patients in the placebo group had evaluable MRI scans at 1 year follow-up, at this timepoint, mean TKV increased significantly less in the octreotide-LAR group (46  2 mL, SE 18  2) compared with the placebo group (143  7 mL, 26  0; p=0  032). 35 patients in each group had evaluable MRI scans at 3 year follow-up, at this timepoint, mean TKV increase in the octreotide-LAR group (220  1 mL, 49  1) was numerically smaller than in the placebo group (454  3 mL, 80  8), but the difference was not significant (p=0  25). 37 (92  5%) participants in the octreotide-LAR group and 32 (82  1%) in the placebo group had at least one adverse event (p=0  16). Participants with serious adverse events were similarly distributed in the two treatment groups. However, four cases of cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis occurred in the octreotide-LAR group and were probably treatment-related. INTERPRETATION: These findings provide the background for large randomised controlled trials to test the protective effect of somatostatin analogues against renal function loss and progression to end-stage kidney disease.

11815731|t|Clinical and novel molecular findings in a 6.8-year-old Turkish boy with triple A syndrome.
11815731|a|BACKGROUND: The triple A syndrome is characterized by the main features adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. Other organ systems can be involved in a variable manner. PATIENT: We report clinical and novel molecular findings in a 6.8-year-old Kurdish boy, who presented with relapsing vomiting and failure to thrive. He was diagnosed as having achalasia and primary adrenocortical hypofunction. History and clinical examination showed that the boy was unable to produce tears. In addition, a large number of associated neurological and dermatological features was present in this patient. Thus, the clinical diagnosis of triple A syndrome was made. RESULTS: Initial molecular marker analysis supported linkage to the triple A critical region on chromosome 12q13. Further, a homozygous G --&gt;A transition in exon 9 of the newly identified AAAS gene, resulting in a stop codon (W295X) and predicting a truncated protein with loss of function, confirmed the diagnosis. This new mutation was also detected in another family of Kurdish origin. In turned out that both families were related.

26637259|t|Allgrove syndrome: a report of a unique case characterised by peculiar dental findings resembling those of ectodermal dysplasia.
26637259|a|BACKGROUND: Triple A or Allgrove Syndrome (OMIM#231550) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which patients typically suffer from chronic adrenal insufficiency due to resistance to ACTH (Addison's disease), esophageal achalasia, and defective tear formation (alacrima). The syndrome is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding a 546 aminoacid protein named alacrimia-achalasia-adrenal insufficiency neurologic disorder (ALADIN), a constituent of eukaryotic nuclear pore complexes. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of Allgrove Syndrome presenting with anhidrosis and peculiar dental features resembling those of Ectodermal Dysplasia (ED). CONCLUSION: Given the clinical findings in this case we suggest the hypothesis that the pathogenetic mechanism in Allgrove syndrome is related to the ED.

27671188|t|Allgrove Syndrome: Adrenal Insufficiency with Hypertensive Encephalopathy.
27671188|a|Allgrove syndrome or triple-Asyndrome is a rare familial multisystem autosomal recessive disorder. It is characterised by triad of alacrima, achalasia and adrenal insufficiency due to adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) resistance. If it is associated with autonomic dysfunction, it is termed as 4-Asyndrome. This syndrome is caused by a mutation in the Achalasia - Addisonism - Alacrima (AAAS) gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the nuclear pore protein ALADIN. A5-year boy presented with history of fits and altered sensorium for one day. He also had increased pigmentation of body and persistent vomiting since six months of age. Laboratory investigations and imaging revealed alacrimia, achalasia and adrenal insufficiency due to ACTH resistance. He had episodes of hypertensive crises, for which he was thoroughly investigated and it was found to be due to autonomic instability. Based on clinical findings and investigations he was diagnosed as case of Allgrove syndrome or 4-Asyndrome with autonomic dysfunction.

27707803|t|A novel TRAPPC11 mutation in two Turkish families associated with cerebral atrophy, global retardation, scoliosis, achalasia and alacrima.
27707803|a|BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome (MIM #231550) is associated with mutations in the AAAS gene. However, about 30% of patients with triple A syndrome symptoms but an unresolved diagnosis do not harbour mutations in AAAS. OBJECTIVE: Search for novel genetic defects in families with a triple A-like phenotype in whom AAAS mutations are not detected. METHODS: Genome-wide linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing and functional analyses were used to discover and verify a novel genetic defect in two families with achalasia, alacrima, myopathy and further symptoms. Effect and pathogenicity of the mutation were verified by cell biological studies. RESULTS: We identified a homozygous splice mutation in TRAPPC11 (c.1893+3A&gt;G, [NM_021942.5], g.4:184,607,904A&gt;G [hg19]) in four patients from two unrelated families leading to incomplete exon skipping and reduction in full-length mRNA levels. TRAPPC11 encodes for trafficking protein particle complex subunit 11 (TRAPPC11), a protein of the transport protein particle (TRAPP) complex. Western blot analysis revealed a dramatic decrease in full-length TRAPPC11 protein levels and hypoglycosylation of LAMP1. Trafficking experiments in patient fibroblasts revealed a delayed arrival of marker proteins in the Golgi and a delay in their release from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Mutations in TRAPPC11 have previously been described to cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2S (MIM #615356). Indeed, muscle histology of our patients also revealed mild dystrophic changes. Immunohistochemically, b-sarcoglycan was absent from focal patches. CONCLUSIONS: The identified novel TRAPPC11 mutation represents an expansion of the myopathy phenotype described before and is characterised particularly by achalasia, alacrima, neurological and muscular phenotypes.

27754849|t|Identification of a novel putative interaction partner of the nucleoporin ALADIN.
27754849|a|UNASSIGNED: It has been shown that the nucleoporin ALADIN plays a significant role in the redox homeostasis of the cell, but its function in steroidogenesis contributing to adrenal atrophy in triple A syndrome remains largely unknown. In an attempt to identify new interaction partners of ALADIN, co-immunoprecipitation followed by proteome analysis was conducted in different expression models using the human adrenocortical tumour cell line NCI-H295R. Our results suggest an interaction of ALADIN with the microsomal protein PGRMC2. PGRMC2 is shown to be activity regulator of CYP P450 enzymes and, therefore, to be a possible target for adrenal dysregulation in triple A syndrome. We show that there is a sexual dimorphism regarding the expression of Pgrmc2 in adrenals and gonads of wild-type (WT) and Aaas knock-out (KO) mice. Female Aaas KO mice are sterile due to delayed oocyte maturation and meiotic spindle assembly. A participation in meiotic spindle assembly confirms the recently investigated involvement of ALADIN in mitosis and emphasises an interaction with PGRMC2 which is a regulator of the cell cycle. By identification of a novel interaction partner of ALADIN, we provide novel aspects for future research of the function of ALADIN during cell cycle and for new insights into the pathogenesis of triple A syndrome.

27895694|t|Edentulous child with Allgrove syndrome: a rare case report.
27895694|a|UNASSIGNED: Triple-A syndrome, also known as Allgrove syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The 3 features of this syndrome are achalasia, adrenal insufficiency, and alacrima. Achalasia could be the first manifestation of the triple-A syndrome; however, its etiology is unclear. Alacrima is generally asymptomatic but can be detected by obtaining patient history. Although adrenal insufficiency could have manifestations such as asthenia, it might be wrongly diagnosed as muscle fatigue. Vitamin D and calcium supplements are usually prescribed for the prevention of osteoporosis. Neurologic manifestations could be present in adults. In some individuals with this disorder, genetic examination indicates mutations in both alleles of the AAAS gene, which encodes a special 546-amino-acid protein designated ALADIN, and in chromosome 12q13. The genetic cause of the triple A syndrome in some patients who do not have an identified mutation is unknown. While very few such cases have been reported till date, one such case was presented to us as an edentulous child.

28447029|t|Cornell Alliance for Science Evaluation of Consensus on Genetically Modified Food Safety: Weaknesses in Study Design.
28447029|a|Cornell Alliance for Science has launched an initiative in which "citizen scientists" are called upon to evaluate studies on health risks of genetically modified (GM) crops and foods. The purpose is to establish whether the consensus on GM food safety claimed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is supported by a review of the scientific literature. The Alliance's citizen scientists are examining more than 12,000 publication abstracts to quantify how far the scientific literature supports the AAAS's statement. We identify a number of fundamental weaknesses in the Alliance's study design, including evaluation is based only on information provided in the publication abstract; there is a lack of clarity as to what material is included in the 12,000 study abstracts to be reviewed, since the number of appropriately designed investigations addressing GM food safety are few; there is uncertainty as to whether studies of toxic effects arising from GM crop-associated pesticides will be included; there is a lack of clarity regarding whether divergent yet equally valid interpretations of the same study will be taken into account; and there is no definition of the cutoff point for consensus or non-consensus on GM food safety. In addition, vital industry proprietary biosafety data on GM crops and associated pesticides are not publicly available and is thus cannot inform this project. Based on these weaknesses in the study design, we believe it is questionable as to whether any objective or meaningful conclusion can be drawn from the Alliance's initiative.
